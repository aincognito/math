\begin{definition} 
Suppose $f$ is analytic at $z_0$. Then the complex power series
\[
\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(k)}(z_0)}{k!}(z-z_0)^k
\]
is called the Taylor series representation for $f$ centered at $z_0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
Suppose $f$ is analytic at $z_0$. Then there exists $\rho >0$ such that for all $z \in D(z_0, \rho), \,f(z)$ is equal to its Taylor series representation centered at $z_0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}[example 1]
Find the Taylor series representation for $f(z) = \sin(z)$ centered at the origin.\\
The derivatives of $\sin z$ evaluated at the origin form the sequence $\{0, 1, 0, -1,...\}$,
where this cycle of length four repeats indefinitely.
Hence the series is 
\[
\sin z = z - \frac{z^3}{3!} + \frac{z^5}{5!} - \dots
\]
which can be written as
\[
\sin z = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{z^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}
\]
The ratio test shows that this series converges for all $z$.
When the center of the Taylor series is the origin, it is referred to as the Maclaurin series for the function.
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 1a)
Find the Maclaurin series for $f(z) = e^z$ and find its radius of convergence.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}(problem 1b)
Find the Maclaurin series for $f(z) = \cos(z)$ and find its radius of convergence.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}(problem 1c)
Find the Taylor series for $f(z) = e^z$ centered at $\pi i$ and find its radius of convergence.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}(problem 1d)
Find the Taylor series for $f(z) = \Log(z)$ centered at $i$ and find its radius of convergence.

\begin{example}[example 2]
Find the Maclaurin series for $f(z) = z\sin(\pi z)$.\\
First note that $f(z)$ is an entire function, so it has a Maclaurin series representation.
Using the Maclaurin series for $\sin z$ gives
\[
z\sin(\pi z) = z\sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{(\pi z)^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{\pi^{2k+1} z^{2k+2}}{(2k+1)!}
\]
The ratio test shows that this series converges for all $z$.
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 2a)
Find the Maclaurin series for $f(z) = e^{-z^2}$ and find its radius of convergence.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}(problem 2b)
Find the Maclaurin series for $f(z) = z\cos(\pi z)$ and find its radius of convergence.

\begin{example}[example 3]
Find the first few terms of the Maclaurin series for $f(z) = \tan z$.\\
Since $\tan z = \frac{\sin z}{\cos z}$ and $\cos 0 \neq 0$, $\tan z$ is analytic at the origin 
and has a Maclaurin series expansion:
\[
\tan z = \sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k z^k = c_0 + c_1 z + c_2 z^2 + \cdots
\]
Using the Maclaurin series of $\sin z$ and $\cos z$ and writing $\sin z = \tan z \cdot \cos z$ we have
\[
z-\frac{z^3}{3!} + \frac{z^5}{5!} - \cdots = \left(c_0 + c_1 z + c_2 z^2 + \cdots\right) \cdot \left(1-\frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} - \cdots \right)
\]
Multiplying on the RHS and comparing coefficients leads to a system of equations:
\begin{align*}
0 & = c_0 \\
1 & = c_1 \\
0 & = c_2 -\frac{c_0}{2!} \\
-\frac{1}{3!} & =  c_3- \frac{c_1}{2!} \\
0 & = c_4 - \frac{c_2}{2!} +  \frac{c_0}{4!} \\
 \frac{1}{5!} & = c_5- \frac{c_3}{2!} +  \frac{c_1}{4!}\\
 & \text{etc.}
\end{align*}
Solving this system yields $c_0 = c_2 = c_4 = 0$, etc., and  $c_1 = 1, c_3 = \frac13, c_5 = \frac{2}{15}$ etc.
Hence 
\[
\tan z = z + \frac13 z + \frac{2}{15}z^3 + \cdots
\]
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 3)
Find the first few terms of the Maclaurin series for $f(z) = \sec z$.
