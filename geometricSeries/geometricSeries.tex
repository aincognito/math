\section{Definition of Infinte Series}

\begin{definition}[Infinite Series]
We define
\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n = \lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{n=1}^N a_n.\]
If this limit is a finite number, then we say that the infinite series \textbf{converges}.
If this limit is not finite or if it does not exist, then we say that the infinite series \textbf{diverges}.

\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The sum, $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^N a_n}$, is called the $N^{th}$ partial sum of the infinite series
$\displaystyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n}$. Thus, in words, we define an infinite series to be the limit of its partial sums.
This is similar to an improper integral which is also defined in terms of a limit.
\end{remark}

\section{Geometric Series}

\begin{definition}[Geometric Series] A \textbf{geometric series} is an infinite series of the form
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \cdots.
\]
The parameter $r$ is called the \textbf{common ratio}.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[example 1]
Consider the series:
\[
 \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{3}{2^n} 
 \]
 Write out the first four terms of the series. If the series is geometric, find the common ratio.
 
 The first four terms are \[
 3 + \frac32 + \frac34 + \frac38 + \cdots.
 \]

 The series is geometric and the common ratio is $\frac12$.
 \end{example}
 
 

\begin{problem}(problem 1a)
 Write the first four terms of the infinite series and answer the questions below:
 \[
 \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2}{3^n} 
 \]
 
 True or false: this is a geometric series \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{True}\choice{False}}
 
 The first term is $a = \answer{2}$\\
 The common ratio is $r = \answer{1/3}$
 \end{problem}
 
 
 \begin{problem}(problem 1b)
 Write the first four terms of the infinite series and answer the questions below:
 \[
 \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{3}{2^n} 
 \]
 
 True or false: this is a geometric series \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{True}\choice{False}}
 
 The first term is $a = \answer{3/4}$\\
 The common ratio is $r = \answer{1/2}$
 \end{problem}
 
 
 \begin{example}[example 2]
 Consider the series:
\[
 \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{3}{n^2} 
 \]
 Write out the first four terms of the series. If the series is geometric, find the common ratio.
 
 The first four terms are 
 \[
 3 + \frac34 + \frac39 + \frac{3}{16} + \cdots.
 \]
 The ratio of the second term to the first is $\frac14$ but the ratio of the third term to the second is $\frac49$.
 The series is not geometric because it fails to have a \it{common} ratio.
 
 \end{example}
 

 
\begin{problem}(problem 2a)
 Write the first four terms of the infinite series and answer the questions below:
 \[
 \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n} 
 \]

 \end{problem}

 \]

 \end{problem}
 
 
\section{Convergence}

\begin{theorem}[Convergence of Geometric Series] 
The geometric series
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n
\]
converges if and only if the common ratio $r$ satisfies the condition $-1 < r < 1$.
This condition can also be written as $|r| < 1$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}[example 3]
Does the geometric series $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{3}{2^n}}$ converge or diverge?\\
The common ratio of this geometric series is $r = \frac12$. Since $-1 < \frac 12 < 1$,
the series converges.
\end{example}


\begin{problem}(problem 3a)

 \[
 \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{3}{2^n}

 \end{multipleChoice}
 \end{problem}
 

\begin{problem}(problem 3b)

 \end{problem}
 
 
 
 
\begin{example}[example 4]
Does the geometric series $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{3^n}{2^{n+1}}}$ converge or diverge?\\
The common ratio of this geometric series is $r = \frac32$. Since $\frac32$ is not between $-1$ and $1$,
the series does not converge, i.e., it diverges.
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 4a)
 Does the geometric series
 \[
 \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2^{n+1}}{3^n} 
 \]

\begin{example}[example 5]
Does the geometric series $\displaystyle{\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(-\frac23\right)^n }$ converge or diverge?\\
The common ratio of this geometric series is $r = -\frac23$. Since $-1 < -\frac23 < 1$,
the series converges.
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 5)
 Does the geometric series
 \[
 \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(-\frac56 \right)^n
 \]
 converge or diverge?\\
 The common ratio is $r = \answer{-5/6}$\\
 The series
 \begin{multipleChoice}
 \choice[correct]{converges}
 \choice{diverges}
 \end{multipleChoice}
 \end{problem}

\section{Sum of a Geometric Series}

Consider the geometric series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n$ where $|r| < 1$ (so that the series converges).
The $N^{th}$ partial sum of this series is given by
\[
S_N = \sum_{n=0}^N ar^n = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{N-1} + ar^N.
\]
Multiply both sides by $r$:
\[
rS_N =  ar + ar^2 + + ar^3 + \cdots  + ar^N + ar^{N+1}.
\] 
Now subtract $rS_N$ from $S_N$:
\begin{align*}
S_N - rS_N &= \left(a + ar + \cdots + ar^{N-1} + ar^N\right) - \left(ar + ar^2 + \cdots  + ar^N + ar^{N+1} \right)\\
           &= a - ar^{N+1}.
\end{align*}
We can factor out $S_N$ on the left side and then divide by $1-r$ to obtain
\[
S_N = \frac{a - ar^{N+1}}{1-r}.
\]
We can now compute the sum of the geometric series by taking the limit as $N \to \infty$:
\[
S = \sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n = \lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{n=0}^N ar^n = \lim_{N \to \infty} S_N = \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{a - ar^{N+1}}{1-r} = \frac{a}{1-r}.
\]
We present this formula in the theorem below.

\begin{theorem}[Sum of a Geometric Series]
If $-1 < r < 1$, then the sum of the geometric series 
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots
\] is given by 
\[
S = \frac{a}{1-r}.
\]
That is, if $-1 < r < 1$, then
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n = \frac{a}{1-r}.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}[example 6]
Find the sum of the geometric series 
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{3}{2^n}.
\]
The first term is $a = 3$, and the common ratio is $r = \frac12$. The sum of the series is
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{3}{2^n} = \frac{3}{1-\frac12} = \frac{3}{\left(\frac12\right)} = 6.
\]
\end{example}

\begin{example}[example 7]
Find the sum of the geometric series 
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(-\frac23\right)^n.
\]
The first term is $a = 1$, and the common ratio is $r = -\frac23$. The sum of the series is
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(-\frac23\right)^n = \frac{1}{1-\left(-\frac23\right)} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac23} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac53\right)} = \frac35.
\]
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 7a)

\end{problem}

\begin{example}[example 8]
Write the repeating decimal $0.\overline{123} = 0.123123123...$ as a ratio of integers.\\
First, note that we can write this repeating decimal as an infinite series:
\[
0.\overline{123} = 0.123 + 0.000123 + 0.000000123 + \dots
\]
Wring these decimals as fractions, we have
\[
0.\overline{123} =\frac{123}{10^3} + \frac{123}{10^6}+\frac{123}{10^9} + \dots
\]
This is a convergent geometric series with first term, $a = \frac{123}{1000}$ and common ratio $r = \frac{1}{1000}$.
The sum is 
\[
S = \frac{a}{1-r} = \frac{\left(\frac{123}{1000}\right)}{1-\frac{1}{1000}} = \frac{\left(\frac{123}{1000}\right)}{\left(\frac{999}{1000}\right)}
= \frac{123}{999} = \frac{41}{333}.
\]
