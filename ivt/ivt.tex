\section{Intermediate Value Theorem}


In this section, we introduce an important theorem related to continuous functions, the Intermediate Value Theorem. 
To build intuition, let us consider two real-life scenarios: the behavior of ambient temperature and the balance in a bank account.
Suppose the temperature is \(65^\circ\) at 8 a.m. and \(75^\circ\) at noon. Because temperature changes continuously, 
we can be certain that at some time between 8 a.m. and noon, the temperature was exactly \(70^\circ\). 
This conclusion follows from the continuous nature of temperature: it does not jump abruptly from one value to another but passes smoothly through all intermediate values.
Now, consider a different scenario involving a bank account. Suppose the account balance is \$65 at 8 a.m. and \$75 at noon. 
Can we similarly conclude that the account balance was exactly \$70 at some time between 8 a.m. and noon? Unlike the temperature example, we cannot make this claim with certainty. 
Hereâ€™s why: It is possible that a single deposit of \$10 was made at 11 a.m., causing the balance to jump directly from \$65 to \$75 without ever being exactly \$70. 
On the other hand, if the \$10 were added in smaller increments (e.g., two deposits of \$5 each), the account could indeed have had a balance of \$70 at some point. 
This uncertainty arises because bank account balances can change discontinuously due to individual transactions, which may create jumps in value.
The fundamental difference between these two scenarios lies in the concept of continuity. 
Temperature changes continuously, while bank account balances can exhibit discontinuities. 
Continuity ensures that if a quantity changes from one value to another, it must pass through every intermediate value in between. 
In contrast, discontinuous changes allow for abrupt jumps, skipping over intermediate values entirely.
Mathematically, this property is captured by the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT):






\begin{theorem}[Intermediate Value Theorem]
If the function $f(x)$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ 
and $I$ is a number strictly between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$,
then there exists a number $c$ in the open interval $(a,b)$ such that $f(c) = I$.
This means that the equation $f(x) = I$ has at least one solution in the open interval $(a,b)$. 
\end{theorem}
The IVT formalizes our intuition about continuous change. It guarantees that for any continuous function, 
every intermediate value between \( f(a) \) and \( f(b) \) must occur at least once within the interval \([a, b]\).
In the examples above, the temperature behaves like a continuous function, making the IVT applicable and ensuring that the value \(70^\circ\) was reached. 
In contrast, the bank account balance behaves like a discontinuous function, so the IVT cannot be applied, and we cannot draw the same conclusion.\\
The value $I$ in the theorem is called an \textbf{intermediate value} for the function $f(x)$ 
on the interval $[a,b]$. 
%Note that if a function is \textit{not continuous} on an interval, 
%then the equation $f(x) = I$ might not have a solution on the interval. \\

The following figure illustrates the IVT.

\begin{example}[example 1]
Show that the equation $x^3 = 10$ has a solution between $x = 2$ and $x = 3$.\\
First, the function $f(x) = x^3$  is continuous on the interval $[2,3]$ 
since is a polynomial. 
Second, observe that 
\[
f(2) = 2^3 = 8,
\]
and 
\[
f(3) = 3^3 = 27,
\] 
so that 10 is an intermediate value, i.e.,
\[f(2) < 10 < f(3).\]
Now we can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to
conclude that the equation $x^3 = 10$ has a least one solution between $x=2$ and $x=3$. 
In this example, the number 10 is playing the role of $I$ in the statement of the theorem.

\end{multipleChoice}
\end{center}


$f(2) = \answer{16}, f(3) = \answer{81}$ and $I = \answer{50}.$

\begin{multipleChoice}
  \choice[correct]{Yes}
  \choice{No}
\end{multipleChoice}

Can we apply the IVT to conclude that the equation $x^4 = 50$ has a solution in the open interval $(2, 3)$?
\begin{multipleChoice}
  \choice[correct]{Yes}
  \choice{No}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}




\begin{example}[example 2]
Show that the equation $e^x =2$ has a solution between $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\\

First, note that the function $f(x) = e^x$ is continuous on the 
interval $(-\infty, \infty)$ and hence it is continuous on the sub-interval, $[0, 1]$. 
Next, observe that 
\[
f(0) = e^0 = 1,
\]
and 
\[
f(1) = e^1 = e \approx 2.7,
\]
 so that 2 is an intermediate value, i.e.,
\[f(0) < 2 < f(1).\]
Finally, by the Intermediate Value Theorem we can 
conclude that the equation $e^x = 2$ has a solution on the open interval $(0,1)$.
In this example, the number 2 is playing the role of $I$ in the statement of the theorem.
\end{example}



\begin{problem}(problem 2)
Determine whether the IVT can be used to show that the equation $\frac{1}{x} = 0$ has a solution in the open interval $(-1, 1).$\\

  \choice{No}
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{multipleChoice}
  \choice{Yes}
  \choice[correct]{No}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}




\begin{example}[example 3]
Show that the function $p(x) = x^4 - 3x - 7$ has a root in the open interval $(-2, 1)$.\\

Recall that a root of a polynomial occurs when $p(x) = 0$. Since $f(x)$ is a polynomial, it is continuous on the interval 
$[-2, 1]$. Plugging in the endpoints shows that 0 is an intermediate value:
\[f(-2) = (-2)^4 - 3(-2) - 7 = 16 + 6 - 7 = 15 \]
and
\[f(1) = (1)^4 - 3(1) - 7 = 1 -3 - 7 = -9 \]
so 
\[f(1) < 0 < f(-2).\]
By the IVT, we can conclude that the equation $x^4 - 3x - 7 = 0$ has a solution (and hence $p(x)$ has a root) 
on the open interval $(-2, 1)$.
\end{example}

  \choice{No}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{center}

$p(1) = \answer{-1}, p(2) = \answer{9}$ and $I = \answer{0}.$

Is $I$ an intermediate value? 
\begin{multipleChoice}
  \choice[correct]{Yes}
  \choice{No}
\end{multipleChoice}

  \choice[correct]{Yes}
  \choice{No}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}

\begin{hint}

\begin{multipleChoice}
  \choice{Yes}
  \choice[correct]{No}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}




\begin{example}[example 4]
Show that the equation $\cos(x) = x$ has a solution 
between $x = 0$ and $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$. \\
Note that the equation $\cos(x) = x$ is equivalent to the equation $x - \cos(x) =0$.
The latter is the preferred form for using the IVT.
So let 
\[f(x) = x - \cos(x).\] 
 Since $f(x)$ is the difference between two continuous functions,
it is continuous on the closed interval $[0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$. 
Next, we compute $f(0)$ and $f(\frac{\pi}{2})$ and show that 0 is an intermediate value:
\[f(0) = 0 - \cos(0) = 0-1 = -1 \]
and
\[f\big(\frac{\pi}{2}\big) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \cos\big(\frac{\pi}{2}\big) = \frac{\pi}{2}-0 = \frac{\pi}{2} \]
and so,
\[f(0) < 0 < f(\frac{\pi}{2}).\]
By the IVT, the equation $ x - \cos(x) =0$ has a solution in the open 
interval $(0, \frac{\pi}{2})$. Hence the equivalent equation $\cos(x) = x$ 
has a solution on the same interval.
\end{example}


\begin{problem}(problem 4)
Use the IVT to show that the equation $e^x = |x|$ has a solution in the open interval $(-1, 1)$.\\
\begin{hint}
Rewrite the equation in the form $f(x) = 0$
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
The functions $e^x$ and $|x|$ are continuous for all $x$
\end{hint}
\end{problem}

\begin{example}[example 5]
Use the IVT four times to approximate a root of the polynomial 
\[p(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 6.\]
First, $p(x)$ is a polynomial, so it is continuous on any closed interval.
Next, note that 
\[p(0) = -6 < 0 \ \text{and} \ p(8) = 346 > 0.\]
By the IVT $p(x)$ has a root in the interval $(0, 8)$. 
To use the IVT a second time, we now determine the midpoint of this interval: $(0+8)/2 = 4$ and we 
plug this in to $p(x)$:
\[p(4) =  14 > 0.\]
Combining this with
\[p(0) < 0,\]
we can use the IVT again to conclude that $p(x)$ has a root on the interval $(0, 4)$. 
This interval is half of the original interval- the original interval has been bisected. 
We now use the IVT a third time. The midpoint of the interval $(0, 4)$ is $x=2$. We plug this into $p(x)$:
\[p(2) =  -2 < 0.\]
Combining this with
\[p(4) > 0,\]
we can use the IVT to conclude that $p(x)$ has a root on the interval $(2,4)$. 
This interval is half of the previous interval- the previous interval has been bisected. 
We will do this a fourth and final time. Note that $x = 3$ is the midpoint of the interval $(2,4)$ and
\[p(3) = 6 > 0.\]
Combining this with
\[p(2) < 0,\]
we can use the IVT a fourth time to conclude that $p(x)$ has a root on the interval $(2, 3)$. 
At this stage, our approximation of the root is $x = 2.5$ which is the midpoint of this interval. 
Our error is then no more than $0.5$, which is half the width of the interval.
We will stop here, but the method could theoretically be continued indefinitely giving a better 
approximation to the root each time. This method of approximating roots is called the 
\textbf{Method of Continued Bisection}.
