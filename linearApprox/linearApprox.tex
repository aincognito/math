function near the point of tangency.

\maketitle


Given a function $y=f(x)$, the equation of the tangent line
at the point where $x = a$ is given by
\[y-f(a) = f'(a)(x - a)\]
or
\[y = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a).\]
The main idea of this section is that if we let 
\[L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)\] then 
\[f(a) = L(a)\]
and
\[f(x) \approx L(x)\]
for values of $x$ close to $a$. The function $L(x)$ is called the \textbf{linearization} of $f(x)$ at $x = a$. 
The advantage of working with $L(x)$ is that values of a linear 
function are usually easy to compute.
In a typical linear approximation problem, we are trying to approximate a value of $f(x)$. We need to choose $a$ and create
$L(x)$. Once we have accomplished this, our solution is 
\[f(x) \approx L(x).\]
There are two keys to choosing $a$. First $a$ should be close to the $x$-value of interest and second, 
we must be able to compute the exact value of $f(a)$.

\begin{example}[example 1]
Approximate $\sqrt{5}$ using a linear approximation.\\ 
Let $f(x) = \sqrt x$ and since 4 is near 5 and $\sqrt{4} = 2$, we let 
$a = 4$. To create $L(x)$ we also need to compute $f'(4)$. 
Since 
\[f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \sqrt x = \frac{d}{dx}(x^{1/2})= \frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}   = \frac{1}{2\sqrt x},\] 
we have
\[f'(4) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{4}} = \frac{1}{4}.\]

The linearization of $\sqrt x$ at $x=4$ is now given by
\begin{align*}
L(x) &= f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) \\
&= f(4) + f'(4)(x - 4) \\
&= 2 + \frac{1}{4}(x - 4).
\end{align*}
Finally, if $x$ is near 4, then $\sqrt x \approx L(x)$, so
\[\sqrt{5} \approx L(5) = 2 + \frac{1}{4}(5-4)\]
\[ = 2+ \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4} = 2.25.\]

\begin{example}[example 2]
Approximate $\sqrt{99}$ using linear approximation. \\
Let $f(x) = \sqrt x$ and since 100 is near 99 and $\sqrt{100} = 10$, we let 
$a = 100$. To create $L(x)$ we also need to compute $f'(100)$. 
Since 
\[f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \sqrt x = \frac{d}{dx}(x^{1/2})= \frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}   = \frac{1}{2\sqrt x},\] 
we have
\[f'(100) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{100}} = \frac{1}{20}.\]

The linearization of $\sqrt x$ at $x=100$ is now given by
\begin{align*}
L(x) &= f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) \\
&= f(100) + f'(100)(x - 100) \\
&= 10 + \frac{1}{20}(x - 100).
\end{align*}
Finally, if $x$ is near 100, then $\sqrt x \approx L(x)$, so
\[\sqrt{99} \approx L(99) = 10 + \frac{1}{20}(99 - 100)\]
\[ = 10 - \frac{1}{20} = \frac{199}{20} = 9.95.\]
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 2a)
Find the linearization of $f(x) = \sqrt x$ at $x = 16$ and use it to approximate $\sqrt{18}$.

The linearization is  $L(x) = \answer{4 + .125 (x-16)}$.

The approximation is $\sqrt{18} \approx \answer{4.25}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}(problem 2b)
Find the linearization of $f(x) = \sqrt x$ at $x = 36$ and use it to approximate $\sqrt{34}$.

The linearization is  $L(x) = \answer{6 + (1/12) (x-36)}$.

The approximation is $\sqrt{34} \approx \answer{35/6}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{example}[example 3]
Approximate $\sqrt[3]{10}$ using linear approximation.\\ 
Let $f(x) = \sqrt[3] x$ and since 10 is near 8 and $\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$, we let 
$a = 8$. To create $L(x)$ we also need to compute $f'(8)$. 
Since 
\[f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \sqrt[3] x = \frac{d}{dx}(x^{1/3})= \frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3}   = \frac{1}{3\sqrt[3] {x^2}},\] 
we have
\[f'(8) = \frac{1}{3\sqrt[3]{8^2}} =\frac{1}{3\sqrt[3]{64}}= \frac{1}{12}.\]

Next, 
\begin{align*}
L(x) &= f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) \\
&= f(8) + f'(8)(x - 8) \\
&= 2 + \frac{1}{12}(x - 8)
\end{align*}
and finally,
\[\sqrt[3]{10} \approx L(10) = 2 + \frac{1}{12}(10 - 8)\]
\[ = 2 + \frac{2}{12} = \frac{13}{6} = 2.1{\overline 6}.\]
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 3)
Find the linearization of $f(x) = \sqrt[3] x$ at $x = 27$ and use it to approximate $\sqrt[3]{25}$.

The linearization is  $L(x) = \answer{3 + (1/27) (x-27)}$.

The approximation is $\sqrt[3]{25} \approx \answer{79/27}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{example}[example 4]
We can approximate $e^{-0.1}$ using linear approximation as follows. 
Let $f(x) = e^x$ and since 0 is near $-0.1$ and $e^0 = 1$, we let 
$a = 0$. To create $L(x)$ we also need to compute $f'(0)$. 
Since 
\[f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x,\] 
we have
\[f'(0) = e^0 = 1.\]

Next, 
\begin{align*}
L(x) &= f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) \\
&= f(0) + f'(0)(x - 0) \\
&= 1 + 1(x - 0)\\
& = 1 + x
\end{align*}
and finally,
\[
e^{-0.1} \approx L(-0.1) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.
\]

We conclude this example by computing \textbf{relative error}. Expressed as a percentage, the relative error is given by
\[
\text{relative error} = \Big|\frac{\text{actual} - \text{estimate}}{\text{actual}}\Big| \times 100 \%.
\]
For the actual value, we will use the value of $e^{-0.1}$ from a calculator.
We have
\[
\text{relative error} = \Big|\frac{0.90483741803 - 0.9}{0.90483741803}\Big| \times 100\% = 0.534617373\%.
\]

\begin{problem}(problem 4)
Find the linearization of $f(x) = e^x$ at $x = 0$ and use it to approximate $e^{0.2}$.
Also, find the relative error.

The linearization is  $L(x) = \answer{1 + x}$.

The approximation is $e^{0.2} \approx \answer{1.2}$.

The relative error in this approximation is (to two decimal places) $\answer{1.75}\%$.


\end{problem}

\begin{example}[example 5]
Approximate $\ln(1.1)$ using linear approximation.\\ 
Let $f(x) = \ln x$ and since 1 is near 1.1 and $\ln(1) = 0$, we let 
$a = 1$. To create $L(x)$ we also need to compute $f'(1)$. 
Since 
\[f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \ln x = \frac{1}{x},\] 
we have
\[f'(1) = \frac{1}{1} = 1.\]

Next, 
\begin{align*}
L(x) &= f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) \\
&= f(1) + f'(1)(x - 1) \\
&= 0 + 1(x - 1)\\
&=x-1
\end{align*}
and finally,
\[\ln(1.1) \approx L(1.1) = 1.1 - 1 = 0.1.\]


\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 5)
Find the linearization of $f(x) = \ln x$ at $x = 1$ and use it to approximate $\ln(0.8)$.

The linearization is  $L(x) = \answer{x-1}$.

The approximation is $\ln(0.8) \approx \answer{-0.2}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{example}[example 6]
Approximate $1.9^3$ using linear approximation.\\ 
Let $f(x) = x^3$ and since 2 is near 1.9 and $2^3 = 8$, we let 
$a = 2$. To create $L(x)$ we also need to compute $f'(2)$. 
Since 
\[f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} (x^3) = 3x^2,\] 
we have
\[f'(2) = 3(2^2) = 12.\]

Next, 
\begin{align*}
L(x) &= f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) \\
&= f(2) + f'(2)(x - 2) \\
&= 8 + 12(x - 2)
\end{align*}
and finally,
\[1.9^3 \approx L(2) = 8 + 12(1.9 - 2) \]
\[= 8 - 12(.1) = 8-(1.2) = 6.8.\]
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 6)
Find the linearization of $f(x) = x^4$ at $x = 1$ and use it to approximate $1.1^4$.

The linearization is  $L(x) = \answer{1 + 4 (x-1)}$.

The approximation is $1.1^4 \approx \answer{1.4}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{example}[example 7]
Approximate $\sin(1^{\circ})$ using linear approximation.\\
In the formula 
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \sin(x) = \cos(x) \]
it is understood that the angle is measured in radians. Therefore, in order to use our linear approximation 
formula we need to restate our problem in radians as:  
\[\text{approximate} \ \ \sin\big(\frac{\pi}{180}\big).\]

We let $f(x) = \sin x$ and since 0 is near $\frac{\pi}{180}$ and $\sin(0) = 0$, we let 
$a = 0$. To create $L(x)$ we also need to compute $f'(0)$. 
Since 
\[f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \sin(x) = \cos(x),\] 
we have
\[f'(0) = \cos(0) = 1.\]

Next, 
\begin{align*}
L(x) &= f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) \\
&= f(0) + f'(0)(x - 0) \\
&= 0 + 1(x - 0)\\
&= x
\end{align*}
and finally,
\[\sin(1^{\circ}) = \sin\big(\frac{\pi}{180}\big) \approx L\big(\frac{\pi}{180}\big) = \frac{\pi}{180}.\]
\end{example}
