\begin{definition} 
A {\bf complex power series centered at} ${\bf z_0}$ is a complex series of the form
\[
\sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k(z-z_0)^k = c_0 + c_1 (z-z_0) + c_2 (z-z_0)^2 + c_3 (z-z_0)^3 + \cdots
\]
\end{definition}
Since a complex power series contains a variable, the question is, for which values of the variable, $z$, 
does the complex power series converge? This question is answered by using the root test, as described in the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
Let $\dis L = \limsup_{k \to 0} \sqrt[k]{|c_k|}$ and let $\dis \rho = \frac{1}{L}$.
Then complex power series centered at $z_0$ given by
\[
\sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k(z-z_0)^k
\]
will converge for 
$z \in D(z_0, \rho)$ and diverge for $|z-z_0| > \rho$.\\
The radius, $\rho$, is called the radius of convergence of the complex power series.\\
If $L = 0$, then $\rho$ is understood to be infinity, i.e., the complex power series converges for all $z$.\\
If $L = \infty$, then the power series converges only at its center, $z_0$.\\
A complex power series may converge or diverge points on the circle $C(z_0, \rho)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
The limit $L$, can also be computed from the ratio test as 
\[
L = \limsup_{k \to \infty} \left|\frac{c_{k+1}}{c_k}\right|
\]
provided $c_k \neq 0$ for all but finitely many values of $k$
\end{remark}


\begin{proof}
From the root test, the series  $\dis \sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k(z-z_0)^k$ converges if $z$ satisfies the inequality
\[
\limsup_{k \to 0} \sqrt[k]{|c_k(z-z_0)^k|} = |z-z_0| \limsup_{k \to 0} \sqrt[k]{|c_k|} = |z-z_0| \cdot L < 1
\]
If $L =0$, then the series converges for all $z$. If $L \neq 0$, then the series converges if $|z-z_0| < \frac{1}{L} = \rho$.
Moreover, the root test also shows that if $|z-z_0|  > \frac{1}{L} = \rho$ then the series diverges.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}[example 1]
Find the disk of convergence of the complex power series: $\dis \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{i^k}{k}(z+i)^k$\\
We first compute the limit superior from the root test:
\[
L = \limsup_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{|c_k|} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{\left|\frac{i^k}{k}\right|} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt[k]{k}} = 1
\]
Therefore the radius of convergence is $\rho = 1/L = 1$ and since the center of the power series is $-i$, the disk of convergence is $D(-i, 1)$.
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 1)
Find the disk of convergence of the complex power series: $\dis \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{e^{ik}}{k^2}(z-2i)^k$\\
The center of the power series is $\; \answer{2i}$\\
The limit superior of the coefficients from the root test (or ratio test) is:
\[
\limsup_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{|c_k|} = \; \answer{1}
\]
The disk of convergence is:
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$D(-2i, 1)$}\\
\choice{$D(2i, -1)$}\\
\choice[correct]{$D(2i, 1)$}\\
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}

On its disk of convergence, a power series is an analytic function.
\begin{theorem}
Suppose the complex power series
\[
f(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k(z-z_0)^k
\]
converges on $D(z_0, \rho)$ for some $\rho > 0$.
Then $f$ is differentiable on $D(z_0, \rho)$ and 
\[
f'(z) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty kc_k(z-z_0)^{k-1}
\]
Moreover, $f'$ has the same disk of convergence as $f$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
The formula for $f'$ shows that a power series can be differentiated term by term.
\end{remark}
\begin{corollary}
Suppose the complex power series
\[
f(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k(z-z_0)^k
\]
converges on $D(z_0, \rho)$ for some $\rho > 0$.
Then $f$ is infinitely differentiable on $D(z_0, \rho)$
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Since $f'$ is a power series with the same radius of convergence as $f$, the theorem can be applied to $f'$. Thus,
$f'$ is differentiable and $f''$ has the same radius of convergence as $f'$. Continuing inductively, $f$
has derivatives of al orders, i.e., $f$ is infinitely differentiable on $D(z_0, \rho)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Suppose the complex power series
\[
f(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k(z-z_0)^k
\]
converges on $D(z_0, \rho)$ for some $\rho > 0$. Then we have the following formula for the coefficients:
\[
c_k = \frac{f^{(k)}(z_0)}{k!}
\]
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Since $f$ is infinitely differentiable and the derivative is computed term by term, we have
\[
f^{(j)}(z) = \sum_{k=j}^\infty k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots(k-j+1)c_k(z-z_0)^{k-j}
\]
Plugging in $z_0$ for $z$ and noting that all of the terms of the series are zero except the first (where $k = j$),
we obtain
\[
f^{(j)}(z_0) = j!c_j
\]
Note that we treat the zero power in the first term as 1 when $z=z_0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}[example 2]
Find the derivative of the power series function $\dis f(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^k}{k!}$\\
The ratio test shows that this series converges for all $z \in \C$. It's derivative is
\[
f'(z) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{kz^{k-1}}{k!}= \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{z^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}
\]
Re-indexing so that $k$ starts at $0$ instead of $1$ (i.e. replacing $k-1$ with $k$), yields
\[
f'(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^k}{k!}
\]
But this is the same series as the original function! What function is this?
\end{example}
