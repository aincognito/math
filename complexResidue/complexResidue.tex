Recall that the coefficient $c_{-1}$ in the Laurent series of a function centered at $z_0$,
\[
f(z) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty c_k (z-z_0)^k
\]
is called the residue of $f$ at $z_0$, denoted Res$(f,z_0)$.

If we integrated this Laurent series term by term around a positively oriented simple closed curve, $C$, containing no other 
singularities in its interior besides (possibly) $z_0$ then we would obtain:
\begin{align*}
\int_C \left(\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty c_k (z-z_0)^k \right)\, dz &= \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \left( \int_C c_k (z-z_0)^k \, dz \right)\\
&= c_{-1} \int_C \frac{1}{z-z_0} \, dz \quad \text{(verify)}\\
&= 2\pi i c_{-1} \quad \text{(verify)}\\
&= 2\pi i \text{Res}(f, z_0)
\end{align*}
Combining the above result with the Extended Deformation of Contour Theorem, we obtain the Residue Theorem:

\begin{theorem}[Residue Theorem]
Let $C$ be a positively oriented, simple closed contour and suppose the function $f$ is analytic along $C$ and inside $C$,
except at finitely many isolated singularities at $z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n$. Then
\[
\int_C f(z) \, dz = 2\pi i \sum_{k=1}^n \text{Res}(f,z_k)
\]
\end{theorem}


\begin{example}[example 1a]
Let $C$ be a positively oriented, simple closed contour containing the origin in its interior.
Compute the contour integral
\[
\int_C e^{1/z} \, dz
\]
The integrand has a singularity at the origin (and nowhere else) and its Laurent series centered at $0$ is
\[
e^{1/z} = 1 + \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{2!z^2} + \frac{1}{3! z^3} + \cdots
\]
Hence, Res$(e^{1/z},0) = c_{-1} = 1$. By the Residue Theorem we obtain
\[
\int_C e^{1/z} \, dz = 2\pi i \text{Res}(e^{1/z}, 0) = 2\pi i
\]
\end{example}


\begin{example}[example 1b]
Let $C$ be a positively oriented, simple closed contour containing the points $0$ and $1$ in its interior.
Compute the contour integral
\[
\int_C \frac{e^{1/z}}{1-z} \, dz
\]

The function $\dis f(z) = \frac{e^{1/z}}{1-z}$ has singularities at both $0$ and $1$, we need to find Laurent series for $f$
centered at both of these points.
At $z = 1$, the function $e^{1/z}$ is analytic an hence has a Taylor series centered at $1$ of the form:
\[
e^{1/z} = c_0 + c_1(z-1) + c_2(z-1)^2 + \cdots
\]
The Laurent series for $\frac{1}{1-z}$ centered at $1$ is simply
\[
\frac{1}{1-z} = -\frac{1}{z-1}
\]
Multiplying these Taylor and Laurent series gives the Laurent series for $f$:
\[
\frac{e^{1/z}}{1-z} = -\frac{c_0}{z-1} -c_1 -c_2(z-1) - c_3(z-1)^2 - \cdots
\]
Thus Res$(f, 1) = -c_0 = -e$ since the is the constant term of the Taylor series of $e^{1/z} =$ centered at $1$ is $e^{1/1} =e$.\\
Next, at $z = 0$, the function $\frac{1}{1-z}$ is analytic and has Taylor series
\[
\frac{1}{1-z} = 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + \cdots
\]
and the function $e^{1/z}$ has Laurent series
\[
e^{1/z} = 1 + \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{2! z^2} + \frac{1}{3! z^3} + \cdots
\]
The Laurent series of $f$ is obtained by multiplying these Taylor and Laurent series together
\[
\frac{e^{1/z}}{1-z} = \left(1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + \cdots\right) \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{2! z^2} + \frac{1}{3! z^3} + \cdots\right)
\]
We only need the residue of $f$, so let's compute the coefficient of $\frac{1}{z}$ in the product above.
We get:
\[
\text{Res}(f, 0) = 1 + \frac{1}{2!} +\frac{1}{3!} + \frac{1}{4!} + \cdots = e-1
\]
Finally, we can evaluate the contour integral using the Residue Theorem:
\[
\int_C \frac{e^{1/z}}{1-z} \, dz = 2\pi i \left[\text{Res}(f,0) + \text{Res}(f,1)\right] = -2\pi i
\]
