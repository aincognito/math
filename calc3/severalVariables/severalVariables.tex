\title{3.1 Functions of Several Variables}



\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
In this section we describe functions of two or more variables.
\end{abstract}

\maketitle

A function of two variables has the form
\[
z = f(x, y)
\]
The independent variables are $x$ and $y$ and the dependent variable is $z$. In section 1.8, we saw elliptic paraboloids like
\[
z = \frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{9}
\]
In this equation, we can view $z$ as a function of $x$ and $y$.\\
The area of a rectangle is length times width, so we can express are as a function of two variables:
\[
A = f(l, w)
\]
The price of a good is a function of supply and demand, so we may be able to write
\[
p = f(s, d)
\]
The depth of the ocean is a funcion of the location on its surface, leading to
\[
depth = f(latitude, longitude)
\]
The \textbf{domain} of $f(x, y)$ is the set of coordinate pairs $(x, y)$ in $\R^2$ for which the $f(x, y)$ is a valid mathematical expression.

\begin{example}[Example 1]
Find the domain of the function $f(x, y) = \sqrt{1 - x^2 - y^2}$.\\
The function leads to a meaningful expression if $1 - x^2 - y^2 \geq 0$ which  is equivalent to 
\[
x^2 + y^2 \leq 1
\]
Points satisfying this inequality in $\R^2$ are either inside  or on the unit circle.
The domain is thus the closed unit disk.

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\filldraw[blue!30!white] (0, 0) circle (3.5);
\draw[thick,blue!70!white] (0, 0) circle (3.5);
\draw[thick, <->] (-5, 0) -- (5,0) node[right]{$x$};
\draw[thick, <->] (0, -5) -- (0, 5) node[left]{$y$};
\node at (3.8, -0.3) {$1$};
\node at (-.3, 3.8) {$1$};
\node at (0, -5.5) {The domain of $f(x, y)$ is the closed unit disk};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}


\end{example}

The \textbf{graph} of a function of two variables $f(x, y)$ is the set of points in $\R^3$ of the form
\[
(x, y, f(x,y))
\]
and the graph is called a \textbf{surface}.

\begin{example}[Example 2]
Describe the graph of the function $z = \sqrt{1 - x^2 - y^2}$ in $\R^3$.\\
As mentioned in example 1, the domain of $f$ is the set of all points $(x, y)$ in $\R^2$ such that
\[
x^2 + y^2 \leq 1
\]
which is the closed unit disc, i.e, the unit circle together with its interior.\\
To recognize the surface, square both sides of the equation to get
\[
z^2 = 1 - x^2 - y^2
\]
which is equivalent to
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1
\]
This is the unit sphere in $\R^3$. In the original function, $z\geq 0$ since $z$ is defined using a positive square root. 
Hence, the graph of $z = f(x, y) = \sqrt{1 - x^2 - y^2}$ is the ``northern" hemisphere of the unit sphere (including the equator).
\end{example}



\begin{problem}(Problem 1a)
Describe the graph of the function $z = 3x - 4y$ in $\R^3$.\\
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}(Problem 1b)
Describe the graph of the function $z = x^2 + y^2$ in $\R^3$.\\
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}(Problem 1c)
Describe the graph of the function $z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ in $\R^3$.\\
\begin{hint}
REcall from section 1.8 that the graph of the equation
\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} - \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 0
\]
is a cone.
\end{hint}

\end{problem}

\section{Level Curves}
A \textbf{level curve} for the surface $z = f(x, y)$ is the curve in the $xy$-plane given by
\[
f(x, y) = k
\]
for some real number $k$.\\
Level curves are the basis for topographical maps like the one below.

In the map above, the contour curves are used to indicate elevation.
