We now turn to the problem of finding the absolute maximum and absolute minimum values
of a function of several variables on a closed and bounded subset of its domain.
To say that a set is bounded means that it is a subset of some disk.  And to say that it is closed means that it contains 
all of its boundary points. 
Any disk around a boundary point contains points that are in the set as well as points that are not in the set.
Points that are in the set $S$ which are not boundary points are called interior points.

The unit circle is a closed and bounded subset of $\R^2$.  Every point on the circle is a boundary point.
The unit disk is a bounded set, whose boundary is the unit circle. Every point within the unit disk is an interior point.
The unit disk can be described by the inequality $x^2 + y^2 < 1$.
The closed unit disk is the unit disk together with the unit circle and it can be described by $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$.

Let $S$ be a closed and bounded set in $\R^2$ and $f(x,y)$ a function defined on $S$. 
We wish to find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum values of $f(x,y)$ on $S$.

\begin{theorem}[Extreme Value Theorem]
Let $f(x,y)$ be a continuous function defined on a closed and bounded set $S$.
Then $f(x,y)$ has an absolute maximum and absolute minimum value on $S$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
The absolute maximum and absolute minimum values of a continuous function $f(x,y)$ on a closed and bounded set $S$ 
occur at either a critical point or a boundary point.
\end{theorem}

In the last section, we learned how to find critical points. 
In this section, the focus will be on locating boundary points where the maximum and minimum values can occur.

In practice, the boundary of the set $S$ will be a curve in $\R^2$ (for the unit disk, it was the unit circle).
We will assume that the boundary curve is smooth and that it can be parameterized by $x = x(t), y = y(t)$.
Then, along the boundary, the function will have the form, $f(x, y) = f(x(t), y(t))$, so that $f$ is a function of $t$.
At a point on the boundary where $f$ has either a max or a min, $f$ will have a critical number at that point (with respect to the variable $t$).
This means that $f\,'(t) = 0$ at this point. From the chain rule
\[
0 = f\,'(t) = f_x(x, y) x'(t) + f_y(x,y) y'(t) = \grad f(x,y) \cdot \vector{x'(t), y'(t)}
\]
This means that at the max or min, the gradient of $f$ is orthogonal to the boundary curve.
On the other hand, this boundary curve can be written in the form $g(x,y) = 0$. For example, the unit circle can be written as $g(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0$,
so that we can think of the boundary curve as the level curve of the surface $z = g(x,y)$. We have already seen, that the gradient of $g$ is orthogonal
to its level curves.  Therefore, $\grad g(x,y)$ is also orthogonal to the boundary curve of the region $S$.
Since both $\grad f(x,y)$ and $\grad g(x,y)$ are orthogonal to the boundary curve at the max and min, they must be parallel at these points.
That means that at the maximum and minimum values of $f(x,y)$ along the boundary curve $g(x,y) = 0$ of the set $S$, 
\[
\grad f(x,y) = \lambda \grad g(x,y)
\]
where $\lambda$ is a scalar.
