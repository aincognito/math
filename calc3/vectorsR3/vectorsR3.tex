\title{1.3 Vectors in Space}
%Vectors are represented graphically by arrows.
%and in three dimensions we write $\vec{v} = \vector{x,y, z}$.
%The length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the vector and the arrow points in the direction of the vector.

Just as in $\R^2$, a vector in $\R^3$ is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction.
In $\R^3$, vectors have three components rather than two:
\[
\vec{v} = \vector{x, y, z}
\]
The magnitude of a vector in $\R^3$ comes from the distance formula:
\[
|\vec{v}| = |\vector{x, y, z}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\]
The standard basis vectors in $\R^3$ are
\begin{align*}
\vec{i} &= \vector{1, 0, 0}\\
\vec{j} &= \vector{0, 1, 0}\\
\vec{k} &= \vector{0, 0, 1}\\
\end{align*}
These are unit vectors in the direction of the positive $x, y$ and $z$-axes respectively.
A vector in $\R^3$ can be expressed in terms of these vectors:
\[
\vec{v} = \vector{x, y, z} = x\vec{i} + y\vec{j} + z\vec{k}
\]

The zero vector in $\R^3$ is given by
\[
\vec{0} = \vector{0,0,0}
\]
has a magnitude of $0$ and is not assigned a direction.
As in $\R^2$, a vector in $\R^3$ has an initial point and a final point.  The vector is in standard position if its initial point is the origin.
Also, as in $\R^2$, a the vector with initial point $P = (x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and final point $Q = (x_2, y_2, z_2)$ is given by the difference of the coordinates:
\[
\avec{PQ} = \vector{x_2 - x_1, y_2-y_1, z_2-z_1}
\]
The magnitude of this vector is the distance between the points $P$ and $Q$
\[
|\avec{PQ}| = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 +(z_2-z_1)^2} = d(P, Q)
\]
The operations of scalar multiplication and addition are performed analogously to those in $\R^2$.
If $\vec{v} = \vector{x, y, z}$ and if $c$ is a scalar in $\R$, then
\[
c\vec{v} = c\vector{x, y, z} = \vector{cx, cy, cz}
\]
and if $\vec{v}_1 = \vector{x_1, y_1, z_1}$ and $\vec{v}_2 = \vector{x_2, y_2, z_2}$ are vectors in $\R^3$ then
\[
\vec{v}_1 + \vec{v}_2 = \vector{x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2, z_1+z_2}
\]
The effect on magnitude of multiplication by a scalar is the same in $\R^3$ as it was in $\R^2$:
\[
|c\vec{v}| = |c| |\vec{v}|
\]
Because of this, a unit vector in the same direction as a non-zero vector $\vec{v}$ in $\R^3$ is given by
\[
\vec{u} = \frac{1}{|\vec{v}|} \vec{v}
\]
just as in $\R^2$.

Due to their component-wise computation, the vector operations of scalar multiplication and addition have some familiar properties:
\begin{align*}
&\text{Distributive Property:} & &c(\vec{v}_1 + \vec{v}_2) = c\vec{v}_1 + c\vec{v}_2   \\
& \text{Commutative Property:}& &\vec{v}_1 + \vec{v}_2 = \vec{v}_2 + \vec{v}_1 \\
& \text{Associative Property:}&  &\vec{v}_1 + (\vec{v}_2+ \vec{v}_3) =  (\vec{v}_1 + \vec{v}_2) + \vec{v}_3 \\
&\text{Identity Property:} & &\vec{v} + \vec{0} = \vec{v} \\
& \text{Additive Inverse Property:} & &\vec{v} + (-\vec{v}) = \vec{0} 
\end{align*}

\begin{example}[Example 1]
Find a unit vector in the same direction as $\vec{v} = 2 \vec{i} - 3\vec{j} + 4\vec{k}$.\\
The magnitude of $\vec{v}$ is
\[
|\vec{v}| = |\vector{2, -3, 4}| = \sqrt{4+9+16} = \sqrt{29}
\]
Hence, a unit vector in the direction of $\vec{v}$ is
\[
\vec{u} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{29}}\vec{v} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{29}}\vec{i} - \frac{3}{\sqrt{29}}\vec{j} + \frac{4}{\sqrt{29}}\vec{k}
\]
\end{example}
