A plane in $\R^3$ is determined by three non collinear points. 
However, this fundamental description is not the best starting point for creating the equation of a plane.
Better is to recognize that a plane, $P$, in $\R^3$ is determined by a single point $Q(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and a 
vector $\vec{n} = \vector{a, b, c}$ which is perpendicular to the plane. 
The vector $\vec{n}$ is called the {\bf normal} vector to the plane.
In addition to orthogonal, normal is yet another word for perpendicular.
See the figure below.

Conceptualizing a plane using a point and a normal vector makes it remarkably easy to construct the equation of the plane.
Consider a point $R(x, y, z)$ in $\R^3$.
This point is in the plane $P$ passing through the point $Q(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ with normal vector $\vec{n} =\vector{a, b, c}$
if and only if the vector $\vector{QR}$ is orthogonal to the normal vector $\vec{n}$.
This condition can be written in terms of the dot product.
The point $R(x, y, z)$ must satisfy the equation
\[
\vec{QR} \dotp \vec{n} = 0
\]
This amounts to 
\[
\vector{x - x_0, y-y_0, z-z_0} \dotp \vector{a, b, c} = 0
\]
From the definition of the dot product we can write
\[
a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0
\]
Hence we have the equation of a plane, and we can see how nicely the ingredients $\vec{n} = \vector{a,b,c}$
and $Q(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ fit into it.
Sometimes we prefer to distribute the $a, b$ and $c$ and write the constant on the other side of the equation:
\[
ax + by + cz = ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0
\]
Finally, we replace the clunky constant with $d$ to write the elegant
\[
ax + by + cz = d
\]
Thus a linear equation in three variables gives us the equation of a plane in $\R^3$.
We summarize the results of the preceding computations in the following proposition.
\begin{proposition}[Equation of a Plane in $\R^3$]
Suppose that the vector $\vec{n} = \vector{a,b,c}$ is normal to the plane $P$ passing through the point $Q(x_0, y_0, z_0)$.
Then the equation of the plane can be written as
\[
\vec{n} \dotp \vector{x-x_0, y-y_0, z-z_0} = 0 \quad \text{(Canonical vector form)}
\]
\[
a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0 \quad \text{(Canonical linear form)}
\]
or using $d = ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0$,  we can write the more succinct
\[
\vec{n} \dotp \vector{x, y, z} = d \quad \text{(Standard vector form)}
\]
\[
ax+by+cz = d \quad \text{(Standard linear form)}
\]
\end{proposition}

To describe the line analytically, i.e., to find the equation (or equations) of the line,
we will need the vector associated with these two points and we will also need to take advantage of the end to end method for adding vectors.
Suppose the line $L$ in $\R^3$ goes through the points $P(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $Q(x_2, y_2, z_2)$. The vector from $P$ to $Q$ is given by
\[
\vec{v} = \vec{PQ} = \vector{x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1,z_2-z_1}
\]
This vector is called the direction vector of the line. 
A point on the line can be seen as the final point of and vector emanating from $P$ and parallel to $\vec{v}$.
To describe such points, we rely on the end to end method of vector addition. A point $(x, y, z)$ lies on the line $L$ if
it is the final point of a vector of the form:
\[
\vector{x_1, y_1, z_1} + t\vector{v}
\]
where $t$ is any scalar. See the figure below.

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[ ->] (0,0) -- (1, 2) ;
\draw[red, ->] (1,2) -- (5, 3);
\draw[blue, fill] (3, 2.5) circle (0.05) node[above]{$Q$};
\draw[blue, fill] (1, 2) circle (0.05)node[above]{$P$};
\draw[blue, fill] (0,0) circle (0.05) node[left]{$O$};
\node at (2.5, -0.5) {The vector $\vector{x_1, y_1, z_1} + t\vec{v}$ (in red)};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}
 
If we associate the vector $\vector{x, y, z}$ with the point $(x, y, z)$, then by the end to end method of adding vectors, we see that
\[
\vector{x, y, z} = \vector{x_1, y_1, z_1} + t\vec{v}
\]
To simplify the notation somewhat, if the vector $\vec{v}$ has the form $\vector{a, b, c}$, then this equation becomes
\[
\vector{x, y, z} = \vector{x_1, y_1, z_1} + t\vector{a, b, c}
\]
This is called the {\bf vector form} of the equation of the line $L$ in $\R^3$ which passes through the 
point $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and has direction vector $\vec{v} = \vector{a, b, c}$.\\
Isolating the variables $x, y$ and $z$ by equating the components of the vector form, we obtain the {\bf parametric form} $L$:
\begin{align*}
x &= x_1 + at\\
y &= y_1 + bt\\
z &= z_1 + ct
\end{align*}
Solving these equations for $t$ (assuming $a, b$ and $c$ are all non-zero) we obtain the {\bf symmetric form} of $L$:
\[
\frac{x-x_1}{a} = \frac{y-y_1}{b} = \frac{z-z_1}{c}
\]

\begin{example}
Find the vector form, parametric form and symmetric form for the line in $\R^3$ passing through the points $(2, 1, -4)$ and $(-3, 2, 5)$.\\
The direction vector for the line is 
\[
\vec{v} = \vector{-3-2, 2-1, 5-(-4)} = \vector{-5, 1, 9}
\]
Note that any non-zero multiple of this vector would also serve as a suitable direction vector for $L$. Using the point $(2, 1, -4)$ we have
\[
\vector{x, y, z} = \vector{2, 1, 4} + t\vector{-5, 1, 9} \quad \text{(Vector form)}
\]
\begin{align*}
x &= 2 -5t\\
y &= 1 + t \quad\text{(Parametric form)}\\
z &= 4 + 9t\\
\end{align*}
and
\[
\frac{x-2}{-5} = y-1 = \frac{z-4}{9} \quad \text{(Symmetric form)}
\]
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Find the vector form, parametric form and symmetric form of the line with direction vector $\vec{v} = \vector{2, -7, 4}$ that goes through 
the point $P = (-1, -3, 5)$. \\
The vector form is 
\[
\vector{x, y, z} = \vector{-1, -3, 5} + t\vector{2, -7, 4}
\]
The parametric form is
\begin{align*}
x &= -1 +2t\\
y &= -3 -7t \quad\text{(Parametric form)}\\
z &= 5 + 4t\\
\end{align*}
and the symmetric form
\[
\frac{x+1}{2} = \frac{y+3}{-7} = \frac{z-5}{4} 
\]
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Find the point of intersection of the lines
\[
L_1: \vector{x, y, z} = \vector{4, 6, -2} + t\vector{1, -2, 2}
\]
and 
\[
L_2: \vector{x, y, z} = \vector{-3, 5, -1} + t\vector{2, 1, -1}
\]
To find the point of intersection, it will be helpful to distinguish between the parameters in the two lines.
In $L_1$, replace $t$ with $t_1$ and likewise, replace $t$ by $t_2$ in $L_2$. At the point of intersection, the $x$-coordinates are equal.
This leads to the following equation:
\begin{align*}
x-\text{coordinate of} L_1 &= x-\text{coordinate of} L_2\\
4+t_1 &= -3 + 2t_2
\end{align*}
We wish to solve for $t_1$ and $t_2$, so we need another equation. Equating the $y$-coordinates, we get:
\[
6 -2t_1 = 5 + t_2
\]
Now, we solve the linear system
\begin{align*}
4+t_1 &= -3 + 2t_2\\
6 -2t_1 &= 5 + t_2
\end{align*}
Solving the top equation for $t_1$ gives $t_1 = -7 + 2t_2$.  substituting this into the bottom equation gives
\begin{align*}
6 - 2(-7+2t_2) &= 5 + t_2\\
6 + 14 - 4t_2 & = 5 + t_2\\
15 &= 5t_2\\
t_2 &=3
\end{align*}
Back substituting gives $t_1 = -7 + 2t_2 = -7 + 2(3) = -1$.
Hence, if the lines intersect, it will be at the point where $t_1 = -1$ on $L_1$ and $t_2 = 3$ on $L_2$.
Note that it is possible that the lines do not intersect- in which case, plugging these values in would give different $z$-coordinates.
The vector associated with the point of intersection is
\begin{align*}
L_1: \vector{x, y, z} &= \vector{4, 6, -2} + (-1)\vector{1, -2, 2} = \vector{3, 8, -4}\\
L_2: \vector{x, y, z} &= \vector{-3, 5, -1} + 3\vector{2, 1, -1} = \vector{3, 8, -4}
\end{align*}
Since these agree, we can conclude definitively that the lines do indeed intersect and furthermore, the point of intersection is $(3, 8, -4)$.
\end{example}
Two lines in $\R^3$ which are not parallel but also do not intersect are called skew lines.  
A basic problem is to find the distance between such skew lines 
(finding the distance between parallel lines, while also interesting, turns out to be considerably easier).
Of great importance in solving this problem is the cross product of the direction vectors of the two skew lines.
Since the full solution to the problem involves planes, we will tackle it in the next section, which covers planes in $\R^3$.
