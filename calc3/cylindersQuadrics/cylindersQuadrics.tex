\title{1.8 Cylinders and Quadric Surfaces}
%Vectors are represented graphically by arrows.
%and in three dimensions we write $\vec{v} = \vector{x,y, z}$.
%The length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the vector and the arrow points in the direction of the vector.

\section{Cylinders}
We are all familiar with the right, circular cylinder shown below.

While we frequently refer to this as just a "cylinder", the right circular cylinder is just one of a much larger class of surfaces known as cylinders.

A cylinder in $\R^3$ is a surface that is defined in terms of a plane curve and a line.
In the case of the right circular cylinder, the curve is a circle and the line is any line passing through the circle that is perpendicular to the plane containing the circle.
We can think of the cylinder as being constructed by sliding the circle along the line, as shown below.

In general, a {\bf cylinder} in $\R^3$ is a set of points constructed by sliding a plane curve along a line 
which is not in the plane of the curve that passes through one point on the curve. See the figure below.

For simplicity, we will consider cylinders in which the curve lies in one of the three coordinate planes and the {\bf ruling} line is perpendicular to this plane.
In this case, the equation of the cylinder will have an easily recognized form: one of the variables, $x, y$ or $z$ will be missing from the equation.
For example, the equation $x^2+y^2 = 1$ makes the unit circle in the $xy$-plane.  As an equation in $\R^3$, the variable $z$ is missing.  
This means that the surface corresponding to this equation is obtained from sliding the unit 
circle in the $xy$-plane along the $z$-axis (giving us a right, circular cylinder).


\section{Quadric Surfaces}
A quadric surface is a three dimensional analogue of a conic section.
The primary conic sections are the circle, ellipse, parabola and hyperbola. These can be drawn as curves in $\R^2$.
The corresponding surfaces in $\R^3$ are the sphere, ellipsoid, paraboloid and hyperboloid.

\[
\vec{v} = \vector{x, y, z}
\]
The magnitude of a vector in $\R^3$ comes from the distance formula:
\[
|\vec{v}| = |\vector{x, y, z}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\]
The special basis vectors in $\R^3$ are
\begin{align*}
\vec{i} &= \vector{1, 0, 0}\\
\vec{j} &= \vector{0, 1, 0}\\
\vec{k} &= \vector{0, 0, 1}\\
\end{align*}
These are unit vectors in the direction of the positive $x, y$ and $z$-axes respectively.
A vector in $\R^3$ can be expressed in terms of these vectors:
\[
\vec{v} = \vector{x, y, z} = x\vec{i} + y\vec{j} + z\vec{k}
\]

The zero vector in $\R^3$ is given by
\[
\vec{0} = \vector{0,0,0}
\]
has a magnitude of $0$ and is not assigned a direction.
As in $\R^2$, a vector in $\R^3$ has an initial point and a final point.  The vector is in standard position if its initial point is the origin.
Also, as in $\R^2$, a the vector with initial point $P = (x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and final point $Q = (x_2, y_2, z_2)$ is given by the difference of the coordinates:
\[
\avec{PQ} = \vector{x_2 - x_1, y_2-y_1, z_2-z_1}
\]
The magnitude of this vector is the distance between the points $P$ and $Q$
\[
|\avec{PQ}| = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 +(z_2-z_1)^2} = d(P, Q)
\]
The operations of scalar multiplication and addition are performed analogously to those in $\R^2$.
If $\vec{v} = \vector{x, y, z}$ and if $c$ is a scalar in $\R$, then
\[
c\vec{v} = c\vector{x, y, z} = \vector{cx, cy, cz}
\]
and if $\vec{v}_1 = \vector{x_1, y_1, z_1}$ and $\vec{v}_2 = \vector{x_2, y_2, z_2}$ are vectors in $\R^3$ then
\[
\vec{v}_1 + \vec{v}_2 = \vector{x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2, z_1+z_2}
\]
The effect on magnitude of multiplication by a scalar is the same in $\R^3$ as it was in $\R^2$:
\[
|c\vec{v}| = |c| |\vec{v}|
\]
Because of this, a unit vector in the same direction as a non-zero vector $\vec{v}$ in $\R^3$ is given by
\[
\vec{u} = \frac{1}{|\vec{v}|} \vec{v}
\]
just as in $\R^2$.

Due to their component-wise computation, the vector operations of scalar multiplication and addition have some familiar properties:
\begin{align*}
&\text{Distributive Property:} & &c(\vec{v}_1 + \vec{v}_2) = c\vec{v}_1 + c\vec{v}_2   \\
& \text{Commutative Property:}& &\vec{v}_1 + \vec{v}_2 = \vec{v}_2 + \vec{v}_1 \\
& \text{Associative Property:}&  &\vec{v}_1 + (\vec{v}_2+ \vec{v}_3) =  (\vec{v}_1 + \vec{v}_2) + \vec{v}_3 \\
&\text{Identity Property:} & &\vec{v} + \vec{0} = \vec{v} \\
& \text{Additive Inverse Property:} & &\vec{v} + (-\vec{v}) = \vec{0} 
\end{align*}

\begin{example}
Find a unit vector in the same direction as $\vec{v} = 2 \vec{i} - 3\vec{j} + 4\vec{k}$.\\
The magnitude of $\vec{v}$ is
\[
|\vec{v}| = |\vector{2, -3, 4}| = \sqrt{4+9+16} = \sqrt{29}
\]
Hence, a unit vector in the direction of $\vec{v}$ is
\[
\vec{u} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{29}}\vec{v} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{29}}\vec{i} - \frac{3}{\sqrt{29}}\vec{j} + \frac{4}{\sqrt{29}}\vec{k}
\]
\end{example}
