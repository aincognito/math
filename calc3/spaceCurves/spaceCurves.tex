\maketitle

A plane in $\R^3$ is determined by three non collinear points. 
However, this fundamental description is not the best starting point for creating the equation of a plane.
Better is to recognize that a plane, $P$, in $\R^3$ is determined by a single point $Q(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and a 
vector $\vec{n} = \vector{a, b, c}$ which is perpendicular to the plane. 
The vector $\vec{n}$ is called the \textbf{normal vector} to the plane.
In addition to orthogonal, normal is yet another word for perpendicular.
See the figure below.

Conceptualizing a plane using a point and a normal vector makes it remarkably easy to construct the equation of the plane.
Consider a point $R(x, y, z)$ in $\R^3$.
This point is in the plane $P$ passing through the point $Q(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ with normal vector $\vec{n} =\vector{a, b, c}$
if and only if the vector $\avec{QR}$ is orthogonal to the normal vector $\vec{n}$.
This condition can be written in terms of the dot product.
The point $R(x, y, z)$ must satisfy the equation
\[
\avec{QR} \dotp \vec{n} = 0
\]
This amounts to 
\[
\vector{x - x_0, y-y_0, z-z_0} \dotp \vector{a, b, c} = 0
\]
From the definition of the dot product we can write
\[
a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0
\]
Hence we have the equation of a plane, and we can see how nicely the ingredients $\vec{n} = \vector{a,b,c}$
and $Q(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ fit into it.
Sometimes we prefer to distribute the $a, b$ and $c$ and write the constant on the other side of the equation:
\[
ax + by + cz = ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0
\]
Finally, we replace the clunky constant with $d$ to write the elegant
\[
ax + by + cz = d
\]
Thus a linear equation in three variables gives us the equation of a plane in $\R^3$.
We summarize the results of the preceding computations in the following proposition.

\begin{proposition}[Equation of a Plane in $\R^3$]
Suppose that the vector $\vec{n} = \vector{a,b,c}$ is normal to the plane $P$ passing through the point $Q(x_0, y_0, z_0)$.
Then the equation of the plane can be written in the following ways:
\[
\vec{n} \dotp \vector{x-x_0, y-y_0, z-z_0} = 0 %\quad \text{(Canonical vector form)}
\]
\[
a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0 %\quad \text{(Canonical linear form)}
\]
Using $d = ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0$,  we can write the equations of the plane more succinctly:
\[
\vec{n} \dotp \vector{x, y, z} = d %\quad \text{(Vector form)}
\]
\[
ax+by+cz = d 
\]
The equation $ax+by+cz =d$ is called the \textbf{standard form} for the equation of a plane.
\end{proposition}

\begin{example}[Example 1] 
Find the equation of the plane through the point $(3, 5, -7)$ with normal vector $\vector{1, -1, 2}$.\\
A point $(x, y, z)$ is on the plane if and only if 
\[
\vector{1, -1, 2} \dotp \vector{x - 3, y-5, z+7} =0
\]
Hence, the equation of the plane is
\[
(x-3) - (y-5) + 2(z+7) = 0
\]
or, in standard form,
\[
x - y + 2z = -16
\]
\end{example}

To sketch a plane in $\R^3$, plot its $x, y$ and $z$-intercepts.
% it is helpful to find the intersection of the plane with each of the coordinate planes.  
%These are called the {\bf traces} of the plane.


\begin{example}[Example 2]
Sketch the plane $P$ given by $2x + y + 3z = 6$ by finding its intercepts with each of the coordinate axes.\\
%sketching its traces.\\
To find the $x$-intercept, set $y$ and $z$ equal to $0$:
\[
2x = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
\]
Similarly the $y$ and $z$-intercepts are $y=6$ and $z = 2$ respectively.
The graph of the plane contains the triangle formed by the intercepts as well as the intercepts themselves.
See the figure below.

%The figure below shows the three intercepts along with the triangle formed by them.

%To find the trace of $P$ in the $xy$-plane, we set $z = 0$ and we get
%\[
%2x +y = 6
%\]
%which is the equation of a line in the $xy$-plane.
%To find the trace of $P$ in the $xz$-plane, we set $y = 0$ and we get
%\[
%2x +3z = 6
%\]
%which is the equation of a line in the $xz$-plane
%To find the trace of $P$ in the $yz$-plane, we set $x = 0$ and we get
%\[
% y + 3z = 6
%\]
%which is also the equation of a line in the $yz$-plane.
%Sketching these three lines gives a triangle which determines the plane.
%See the figure below.

\begin{problem}(Problem 2)
Sketch the plane $x - 2y - 4z = 4$ by plotting its $x, y$ and $z$-intercepts.
\end{problem}

Two planes are either parallel or they intersect in a line.
Parallel planes are easy to detect, since they will have the same normal vector and hence their standard forms
will have the same left hand side, i.e., the planes
\[
ax+by+cz = d_1 \quad \text{and} \quad ax+by+cz = d_2
\]
are parallel.


\begin{example}[Example 3]
Find the intersection of the planes 
\[
2x + y + 3z = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad x - y + z = 2
\]
If we can find two points in the intersection, then we can write the vector form of the equation of the line of intersection.
We will choose a $z$-value for each point and then determine the corresponding $x$ and $y$-coordinates in the 
intersection by solving a $2 \times 2$ linear system.\\
For the first point, we can choose $z = 0$. Substituting this into the equations of the planes yields the
following $2 \times 2$ linear system:
\begin{align*}
2x+y &= 6\\
x -y &= 2
\end{align*}
Observe that adding these equations will eliminate the variable $y$,  giving
\[
3x = 8
\]
and hence $x = \frac83$.  Plugging this into the bottom equation (or the top equation), we can find $y$:
\[
 \frac83 -y = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac23
\]
Hence, one point of intersection of the two planes is $P\left(\frac83, \frac23, 0\right)$.\\
For the second point, we can choose $z = 1$. Substituting this into the equations of the planes yields the 
following $2 \times 2$ linear system:
\begin{align*}
2x + y &= 3\\
x - y &= 1
\end{align*}
Adding these equations gives
\[
3x = 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac43
\]
Using the bottom equation (since it is simpler), we find $y$:
\[
\frac43 - y = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac13
\]
Hence, the second point of intersection is $Q\left(\frac43, \frac13, 1\right)$.
The direction vector of the line of intersection of the two planes is the vector
\[
\avec{PQ} = \vector{\frac43 - \frac83, \frac13 - \frac23, 1-0} = \vector{-\frac43, -\frac13, 1}
\]
Using the point $P$ and the direction vector $\avec{PQ}$, we can write the equation of the line of intersection:
\[
\vector{x, y, z} = \vector{\frac83, \frac23, 0} + t \vector{-\frac43, -\frac13, 1}
\]

\end{example}

\begin{problem}(Problem 3)
Find the intersection of the planes $3x - y -4z = 3$ and $x - 4y + z = 2$.\\
\end{problem}


Next, we find the distance between parallel planes.

\begin{example}[Example 4]
Find the distance between the planes 
\[
P_1: x +2y - z = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad P_2: x+2y-z = 4
\]
The planes are parallel since they have the same normal vector, $\vec{n} = \vector{1, 2, -1}$. 
We need one point in each plane and the vector between them.
On $P_1$ we can take the point $Q_1(1, 0, 0)$ and on $P_2$, we can take the point $Q_2(4, 0, 0)$. 
The vector between them is 
\[
\vec{v} = \avec{Q_1Q_2} = \vector{3,0,0} = 3\vec{i}
\]
The distance between the planes is the magnitude of the projection of the vector $\vec{v} = \avec{Q_1Q_2}$ onto the 
normal vector, $\vec{n}$. We have,
\begin{align*}
\text{distance} &= | \proj_{\vec{n}}\vec{v}| \\
               &= \left| \frac{\vec{v}\dotp \vec{n}}{\vec{n}\dotp \vec{n}} \vec{n}\right|\\
               &= \left|\frac{3}{6} \vector{1, 2, -1}\right|\\
               &= \left| \vector{\frac12, 1, -\frac12}\right|\\
               &= \sqrt{\left( \frac12\right)^2 + 1^2 + \left( -\frac12\right)^2}\\
               & = \sqrt{\frac32}
\end{align*}

\maketitle





A curve in $\R^3$ is given by a vector valued function,
\[
\vec r(t) = \vector{f(t), g(t), h(t)}
\]
Note that this ia a vector equation.
