\begin{definition}[Gradient Vector]
For a function of two variables, $f(x,y)$, the gradient vector is defined by
\[
\grad f(x,y) = \vector{f_x(x,y), f_y(x,y)} \quad \text{or just} \quad \vector{f_x, f_y} \quad \text{for short}
\]
Similarly, for a function of three variables, $f(x,y, z)$, the gradient vector is defined by
\[
\grad f(x,y, z) = \vector{f_x, f_y, f_z}
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Example 1]
Find the gradient vector for 
\[
\text{a)} \;f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2\quad \text{and} \quad  \text{b)} \;g(x, y, z) = xyz
\]
a) $\grad f(x,y) = \vector{f_x, f_y} = \vector{2x, 2y}$ \\
b) $\grad g(x,y, z) = \vector{g_x, g_y, g_z}= \vector{yz, xz, yz}$
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(Problem 1)
Find the gradient of each of the following:\\
a) $\;f(x,y) = xy - y^2; \quad \quad \grad f(x,y) = \vector{\answer{y}, \answer{x - 3y^2}}$\\
b) $\;g(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}; \quad \quad  \grad g(x,y) = \vector{\answer{\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}}, \answer{\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}}}$\\
a) $\;h(x,y, z) = x\sin(yz); \quad \quad \grad h(x,y, z) = \vector{\answer{\sin(yz)}, \answer{xz\cos(yz)} , \answer{xy\cos(yz)} }$\\
\end{problem}


\begin{example}[Example 2]
Let $f(x,y) = x^2 + 3xy$.  Find $\grad f(2, -3)$.\\
First we compute the gradient and then we plug in the point $(2, -3)$.  We have
\[
\grad f(x,y) = \vector{f_x(x,y), f_y(x,y)} = \vector{2x + 3y, 3x}
\]
At the given point, we have
\[
\grad f(2, -3) = \vector{2(2) + 3(-3), 3(2)} = \vector{-5, 6}
\]
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(Problem 2)
Let $f(x,y) = 2xy - y^3$.  Find $\grad f(-1, 2)$.\\
\[
\grad f(-1, 2) = \vector{\answer{4}, \answer{-14}}
\]
\end{problem}
The gradient is used to find the slope of a surface in a particular direction.

\begin{definition}[Directional Derivative]
Let $z = f(x,y)$ be a function of two variables whose graph is a surface in $R^3$ and let $\vec u = \vector{a,b}$ be a unit vector in $\R^2$.
The \textbf{derivative of} $\mathbf{f(x,y)}$ \textbf{in the direction of} $\mathbf{\vec u}$ is given by
\[
D_{\vec u} f(x,y) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + ah, y + bh) -f(x,y)}{h}
\]
This derivative gives the \textbf{rate of change of} $\mathbf{f(x,y)}$ \textbf{in the direction of} $\mathbf{\vec u}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Example 3]
Show that the derivative of $f(x,y)$ in the direction of the vector $\vec i = \vector{1,0}$ is the 
partial derivative with respect to $x$, $f_x(x,y)$.\\
Noting that $\vec i$ is a unit vector, we apply the definition of directional 
derivative using $\vec u = \vec i = \vector{1,0}$ to obtain:
\begin{align*}
D_{\vec i} f(x,y) &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + 1h, y + 0h) -f(x,y)}{h}\\
                  &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h, y) -f(x,y)}{h}\\
                  &= f_x(x,y)
\end{align*}
The last equation follows from the definition of the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$.
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(Problem 3)
Use the definition  to show that the derivative of $f(x,y)$ in the direction of 
the vector $\vec j = \vector{0,1}$ is the partial derivative with respect to $y$, $f_y(x,y)$.
\end{problem}


\begin{proposition}
Let $f(x,y)$ be a function of two variables and let $\vec u = \vector{a,b}$ be a unit vector in $\R^2$. Then
\[
D_{-\vec u} f(x,y) = -D_{\vec u} f(x,y)
\]
where the vector $-\vec u = \vector{-a, -b}$ is the negative of the vector $\vec u$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The proof follows from the definition of directional derivative:
\begin{align*}
D_{-\vec u} f(x,y) &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x - ah, y - bh) -f(x,y)}{h} \\
                   &= -\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x - ah, y - bh) -f(x,y)}{-h} \\
                   &= -\lim_{k \to 0} \frac{f(x + ak, y  + bk) -f(x,y)}{k} \\
                   &= -D_{\vec u} f(x,y)
\end{align*}
Note the change of the increment from $h$ to $k$ using $k = -h$.
\end{proof}

The following theorem gives the relationship between the gradient vector and directional derivatives.

\begin{theorem}
Let $f(x,y)$ be a function of two variables with gradient vector $\grad f = \vector{f_x, f_y}$, 
and let $\vec u = \vector{a,b}$ be a unit vector.
Then
\[
D_{\vec u} f(x,y) = \grad f(x,y) \dotp \vec u = \vector{af_x(x,y), bf_y(x,y)}
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
A rigorous proof requires the chain rule which will be covered in a later section. 
However, based solely on the definition, we present here a convincing argument for the conclusion of the theorem. 
The definition of directional derivative gives:
\begin{align*}
D_{\vec u} f(x,y) &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + ah, y + bh) -f(x,y)}{h} \\
                  &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + ah, y + bh) - f(x , y+ bh) + f(x, y+bh) -f(x,y)}{h} \\
                  &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + ah, y + bh) - f(x , y+ bh)}{h} + \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x , y+ bh) -f(x,y)}{h} \\
                  &= a\cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + ah, y + bh) - f(x , y+ bh)}{ah} + b\cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x , y+ bh) -f(x,y)}{bh} \\
                  &= a\cdot \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{f(x + k, y + ck) - f(x , y+ ck)}{k} + b\cdot \lim_{l \to 0} \frac{f(x , y+ l) -f(x,y)}{l} \\
                  &= (?) \; a f_x + bf_y
\end{align*}
In the second to the last line, the constant $c$ is replacing the fraction $b/a$.  
The question mark in the last line is due to the fact that the first limit is not
identical to the definition of $f_x$ since the $y$ coordinates are ``floating".  
However, the $y$ coordinates are equal in the first limit and as $k \to 0$, they are approaching $y$, 
so perhaps this first limit is simply $af_x(x,y)$. 
To strengthen our case for the result, we next present a similar computation, 
changing only the term which was added and subtracted in the numerator:
\begin{align*}
D_{\vec u} f(x,y) &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + ah, y + bh) -f(x,y)}{h} \\
                  &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + ah, y + bh) - f(x+ah , y) + f(x+ah, y) -f(x,y)}{h} \\
                  &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + ah, y + bh) - f(x+ah, y)}{h} + \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+ah , y) -f(x,y)}{h} \\
                  &= b\cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + ah, y + bh) - f(x+ah , y)}{bh} + a\cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+ah , y) -f(x,y)}{ah} \\
                  &= b\cdot \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{f(x + k, y + ck) - f(x+k , y)}{k} + a\cdot \lim_{l \to 0} \frac{f(x+ cl , y+ l) -f(x,y)}{l} \\
                  &= (?)\;  b f_y + af_x
\end{align*}
Here, in the second to the last line, the constant $c$ is replacing the fraction $a/b$.  
The question mark in the last line is due to the fact that the first limit is not
identical to the definition of $f_y$ since the $x$ coordinates are ``floating".  
However, the $x$ coordinates are equal in the first limit and as $k \to 0$, they are approaching $x$, 
so perhaps this first limit is simply $bf_y(x,y)$.
Each of the above computations gives us one of the partial derivatives exactly and the other one in a questionable format. 
This is compelling evidence for the validity of the claim in the theorem.
\end{proof}


\begin{example}[Example 4]
Find the derivative of $f(x,y) = 2x + 5y$ in the direction of the vector $\vector{3,4}$ at the point $(-1, 2)$.\\
Note that the surface $z = f(x,y) = 2x + 5y$ is a plane and at the point $(-1, 2)$ the height of the plane is $z = 2(-1) + 5(2) = 8$.
Now we compute the directional derivative by taking the dot product of the gradient vector (at the given point) with a unit 
vector in the direction of the given vector.
The unit vector in the direction of $\vector{3,4}$ is
\[
\vec u = \frac{\vector{3,4}}{|\vector{3,4}|} = \vector{\frac35, \frac45}
\]
The gradient of $f$ at the point $(-1, 2)$ is
\[
\grad f(-1, 2) = \vector{f_x(-1,2), f_y(-1,2)} = \vector{2,5}
\]
The directional derivative is thus
\[
D_{\vec u} f (-1, 2) = \grad f(-1, 2) \dotp \vec u = 2 \cdot \frac35 + 5 \cdot \frac45 = \frac{26}{5}
\]
Conceptually, this means that the rate of change of $f$ in the direction of $\vec u$ at the point $(-1, 2)$ is $\frac{26}{5}$.
Geometrically, this means that the slope of the plane $z = f(x,y) = 3x + 4y$ at the 
point $(-1, 2, 8)$ in the direction of $\vec u$ is $\frac{26}{5}$.
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
Note that the directional derivative in the last example did not depend on the point $(-1, 2)$.  
This is because our surface was a plane and the slope or rate of change of a plane in a particular 
direction is the same at every point in the plane.
\end{remark}

\begin{problem}(Problem 4)
Find the derivative of $f(x,y) = 4x - 2y$ in the direction of the vector $\vector{4, -3}$ at the point $(0, 6)$.\\
A unit vector in the direction of $\vector{4, -3}$ is $\vec u = \vector{\answer{4/5}, \answer{-3/5}}$\\
The gradient vector at the point $(0,6)$ is $\grad f(0,6) = \vector{\answer{4}, \answer{-2}}$\\
The directional derivative is $D_{\vec u} f(0,6) = \answer{2}$
\end{problem}


\begin{example}[Example 5]
Find the derivative of $f(x,y) = x+y$ at the point $(0,0)$ in the direction of the following vectors:
\[
\vec{i}, \vec{j}, \vector{1,1}, \vector{1, -1}, \vector{5, -12} \;\text{and} \; \vector{-5, 12}
\]
We begin by computing the gradient vector at the point $(0,0)$:
\[
\grad f(0,0) = \vector{f_x(0,0), f_y(0,0)} = \vector{1,1}
\]
Note that the gradient vector did not depend on the point.\\
The derivative in the direction of $\vec i$ is
\[
D_{\vec i} f(0,0) = \grad f(0,0) \dotp \vec{i} = \vector{1,1} \dotp \vector{1,0} = 1
\]
The derivative in the direction of $\vec j$ is
\[
D_{\vec j} f(0,0) = \grad f(0,0) \dotp \vec{j} = \vector{1,1} \dotp \vector{0,1} = 1
\]
Next, the vector $\vector{1,1}$ is not a unit vector, so we divide it by its magnitude to get
\[
\vec u = \vector{\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}, \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}}
\]
The derivative in the direction of $\vec u$ is
\[
D_{\vec u} f(0,0) = \grad f(0,0) \dotp \vec{u} = \vector{1,1} \dotp \vector{\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}, \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}} = \sqrt 2
\]
Note that the vector $\vec u$ above is in the same direction as the gradient vector.

Next, the vector $\vector{1,-1}$ is not a unit vector, so we divide it by its magnitude to get
\[
\vec v = \vector{\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}}
\]
The derivative in the direction of $\vec v$ is
\[
D_{\vec v} f(0,0) = \grad f(0,0) \dotp \vec{v} = \vector{1,1} \dotp \vector{\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}} = 0
\]

Next, the vector $\vector{5,-12}$ is not a unit vector, so we divide it by its magnitude to get
\[
\vec w_1 = \vector{\frac{5}{13}, -\frac{12}{13}}
\]
The derivative in the direction of $\vec{w_1}$ is
\[
D_{\vec{w_1}} f(0,0) = \grad f(0,0) \dotp \vec{w_1} = \vector{1,1} \dotp \vector{\frac{5}{13}, -\frac{12}{13}} = -\frac{7}{13}
\]

Finally, the vector $\vector{-5,12}$ is not a unit vector, so we divide it by its magnitude to get
\[
\vec w_2 = \vector{-\frac{5}{13}, \frac{12}{13}}
\]
The derivative in the direction of $\vec w_2$ is
\[
D_{\vec w_2} f(0,0) = \grad f(0,0) \dotp \vec{w_2} = \vector{1,1} \dotp \vector{-\frac{5}{13}, \frac{12}{13}} = \frac{7}{13}
\]

Note that the last two vectors, $\vec w_1$ and $\vec w_2$, are negatives of one another, and that the 
derivatives in their respective directions are negatives of each other.\\
Below, we show several level curves of the plane $z = f(x,y) = x+y$ along with the given (unitized) direction vectors.

\begin{proposition}
Let $f(x,y)$ be a function of two variables and suppose $\grad f \neq \vec 0$. 
Then, the rate of change of $f$ is greatest in the direction of the gradient vector.

\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The direction of greatest increase is the vector $\vec u$ for which $D_{\vec u}f$ is the largest. 
Recall that the dot product of two vectors is the product of their magnitudes times the cosine of the angle between them.  
Hence a dot product is maximized when the cosine is one, i.e., the angle between the vectors is zero.  
In our context, this leads to the direction of greatest
increase in $f$ as the direction of the gradient as follows:
\begin{align*}
D_{\vec u} f &= \grad f \dotp \vec u = |\grad f| \dot |\vec u| \cos \theta\\
             &= |\grad f| \cos \theta \leq |\grad f|
\end{align*}
where the last inequality is equality if $\cos \theta = 1$, i.e., if the angle between $\vec u$ and $\grad f$ is zero.
But, this angle is zero if and only if $\vec u$ is in the same direction as $\grad f$.  Hence, the directional derivative
$D_{\vec u}$ is maximized when the vector $\vec u$ is a unit vector in the same direction as the gradient vector, $\grad f$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
The direction of greatest decrease in $f$ is in the opposite direction of the gradient vector, $\grad f$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
The result follows from the previous proposition and the fact that $D_{-\vec u} f = -D_{\vec u}$.
\end{proof}
