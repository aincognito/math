In this section, functions will be presented graphically. Recall that the graph of a 
function must pass the \textbf{vertical line test} which states that a vertical line 
can intersect the graph of a function in at most one point.
To understand graphical representations of functions, consider the following graph of a function, $y = f(x)$.



\includeinteractive{gl00b.js}

%\[\graph[xmin=-9, xmax=4, ymin=-5, ymax=11]{y=(x^3 +7x^2)/6}\]



%\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width = 4 in, height = 3 in, angle= 1]{parabola.jpeg}
%\end{center}

The graph of a function is created by letting the $x$-coordinate represent 
the input of the function and the $y$-coordinate represent the corresponding output, i.e., $y = f(x)$.  The general form of a point on the graph of $y = f(x)$ is 
$(x_0, f(x_0))$ for any input value, $x_0$, in the \textbf{domain} of $f$.\\

Notice that the point $(-1,2)$ is on the graph of $f$, shown above.  This means that $f(-1) = 2$.  
Similarly, since the points $(3,-2)$ and $(5,1)$ are also on the graph, we have $f(3) = -2$ and $f(5) = 1$.  


We now consider several examples of limits of functions presented graphically.



\begin{example}[example 1]

For the function, $f$, whose graph is shown below, determine the value of the \textbf{one-sided limit}, 
\[
\lim_{x\to 3^-} f(x).
\]
Note that this is called a one-sided limit because $x$ is approaching $3$ from the left hand side.
%\includeinteractive{gl02.js}
\includeinteractive{gl01b.js}
%\includeinteractive{gl01.js}

%\[\graph[xmin=-5, xmax=8, ymin=-1.5, ymax=5.5]{2^x \left\{ -1 \leq x \leq 1.97 \right\}, (x-2)^2 + (y-4)^2 = 0.01}\]


%\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width = 4 in, height = 2.5 in]{graphical-limit01}
%\end{center}


\vspace{.25in}
Solution: Since $x \to 3^-$ we know that the $x$-value is approaching $3$ and we also know that $x<3$. 
Looking at the graph, we can see that for $x$-values slightly less than $3$ (to the left of 3), 
the $y$-values on the graph are very close to $2$. And as the $x$-value moves toward 3, the corresponding $y$-value on the graph moves toward 2. We can express this using limits as 

\[
\lim_{x\to 3^-} f(x) = 2.
\]

In this example, it is important to note that the open circle at the point $(3,2)$ indicates that that point is not on the graph.  Furthermore, there are no points on the graph with $x$-coordinate equal to 3, which means that $f(3)$ is undefined.
Thus, we see in this example that a function can have a limit as $x$ approaches a value that is not in the domain of the function. 
Interactivity note: if you click on the graph,
a dot will appear on the graph.  
%on the graph will pop-up at the place where you clicked.  
You can then drag that dot along the curve with your mouse.

\end{example}


\begin{problem}(problem 1)




Use the graph of $y = f(x)$ given below to determine
  \[
  \lim_{x\to -4^+} f(x).
  \]
  
    \begin{hint}
      $x$ is to the right of -4
    \end{hint}
    \begin{hint}
      The y-coordinates determine the limit
    \end{hint}
		\begin{hint}
		  Click on the graph and move the dot
		\end{hint}
		The value of the limit is
		 $\answer{3}$

\includeinteractive{glp01.js}
\end{problem}


\begin{example}[example 2]
For the function, $f$, whose graph is shown below, determine the value of the \textbf{two-sided limit}, 
\[
\lim_{x\to 3} f(x).
\]
Note that this is called a two-sided limit because $x$ can 
approach $3$ from either the left hand side or the right hand side.

%\[
%\graph[xmin=-5, xmax=12, ymin=-1, ymax=6]{
%x-1 \left\{-10 \leq x \leq 2.94 \right\}, 
%x-1 \left\{3.06 \leq x \leq 10 \right\}, (x-3)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 0.01,
%(x-3)^2 + (y-4)^2 = 0.01, (x-3)^2 + (y-4)^2 = 0.001, (x-3)^2 + (y-4)^2 = 0.0001,
%(x-3)^2 + (y-4)^2 = 0.009, (x-3)^2 + (y-4)^2 = 0.007, (x-3)^2 + (y-4)^2 = 0.005,
%}
%\]

\vspace{.25in}
Solution: Since $x \to 3$ we know that the $x$-value is approaching $3$ and we also know 
that $x$ can be on either side of $3$ (but not equal to 3). 
Looking at the graph, we can see that for $x$-values either slightly less than $3$ or slightly greater than $3$, 
the $y$-values on the graph are very close to $2$. Thus, 

\[
\lim_{x\to 3} f(x) = 2.
\]

In this example it is important to observe that, even though the function value at $x= 3$ is $4$, 
as indicated by the dot at the point $(3,4)$, the limit of the function as $x$ approaches $3$ is $2$ and not $4$.  
The limit of a function is determined by the behavior of the function \textit{near} the 
indicated $x$-value and not \textit{at} that $x$-value.\\

\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 2)




Use the graph of $y = f(x)$ given below to determine
  \[
  \lim_{x\to 3} f(x).
  \]
  
    \begin{hint}
      This is a two-sided limit
    \end{hint}
    \begin{hint}
      The y-coordinates determine the limit
    \end{hint}
		\begin{hint}
		  Click on the graph and move the dot
		\end{hint}
		The value of the limit is
		 $\answer{1}$

\includeinteractive{glp02.js}
	
\end{problem}

\begin{example}[example 3]
For the function, $f$, whose graph is shown below, find the one-sided limits,
\[\lim_{x \to 1^-}f(x), \lim_{x \to 1^+}f(x),
\] 
and discuss the two-sided limit, 
\[\lim_{x \to 1} f(x).
\]

\includeinteractive{gl03.js}

%-1/x +3 \left\{1 < x \leq 10 \right\}, (x-1)^2 + (y+1)^2 = 0.015, (x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 0.005,

\vspace{.25in}
Solution: As in example 1, we can determine the value of the left hand limit, $\lim_{x \to 1^-}f(x)$, 
by observing that if $x$ is on the left side of 1 and very close to 1 then the $y$-values on the 
graph are very close to -1 and hence, 

\[
\lim_{x \to 1^-}f(x) = -1.
\]

For the right hand limit $\lim_{x \to 1^+}f(x)$, we inspect the $y$-values on the 
graph that correspond to $x$-values on the right side of 1 and very close to $1$.  
We see that these $y$-values are very close to 2, hence

\[
\lim_{x \to 1^+}f(x) = 2.
\]

We see that the one-sided limits as $x$ approaches 1 have different values, and we therefore 
conclude that the two-sided limit, $\lim_{x \to 1}f(x)$, \textbf{does not exist}.  We write

\[
\lim_{x \to 1}f(x) \;\;\text{DNE}.
\]

\end{example}

In general, when the one-sided limits are different then the 
corresponding two-sided limit does not exist.

\begin{problem}(problem 3)


  Use the graph of $y = f(x)$ given below to determine
  \[
  \lim_{x\to -1^-} f(x), \lim_{x\to -1^+} f(x) \ \text{and}
	\]
	\[
	\lim_{x\to -1} f(x).
	\]
  
  
    \begin{hint}
      The y-coordinates determine the limit
    \end{hint}
		\begin{hint}
		  Click on the graph and move the dot
		\end{hint}
		\begin{hint}
		  It is possible that a limit DNE
		\end{hint}
		The value are $\lim_{x\to -1^-} f(x)=\answer{-2}$, 
		$\lim_{x\to -1^+} f(x)=\answer{3}$ and 
		$\lim_{x\to -1} f(x)=\answer{DNE}$


\includeinteractive{glp03.js}

	
\end{problem}


\begin{example}[example 4]
For the function, $f$, whose graph is shown below, find the one-sided limit,
\[
\lim_{x \to 3^+}f(x).
\]

\includeinteractive{gl04.js}

%\[\graph[xmin=2, xmax=6, ymin=-10, ymax=3]{2+log(x-3.01)}\]

%\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width = 4 in, height = 2.5 in]{graphical-limit04}
%\end{center}

\vspace{.25in}
Solution: From the graph, we can see that as the $x$-values approach 3 from the right hand side, the $y$-values decrease without bound.  In this case we write

\[
\lim_{x \to 3^+}f(x) = -\infty.
\]

To describe the phenomenon of an \textbf{infinite limit} as $x$ approaches a finite value (in this case, 3), 
we say that the line $x = 3$ is a \textbf{vertical asymptote} for the graph of $f$.

\end{example}


\begin{problem}(problem 4)

  Use the graph of $y = f(x)$ given below to determine
  \[
  \lim_{x\to 2^-} f(x).
  \]
  
    \begin{hint}
      $x$ is to the left of 2
    \end{hint}
    \begin{hint}
      The y-coordinates determine the limit
    \end{hint}
		\begin{hint}
		  Click on the graph and move the dot
		\end{hint}
		\begin{hint}
		 Type infinity for $\infty$ and -infinity for $-\infty$
		\end{hint}
		The value of the limit is
		 $\answer{\infty}$

\includeinteractive{glp04.js}

	
\end{problem}

\begin{example}[example 5]
For the function, $f$, whose graph is shown below, find the limit,
\[
\lim_{x \to \infty}f(x).
\] 
This is an example of a \textbf{limit at infinity} and it is used to help 
us describe the end behavior of the function.

\includeinteractive{gl05.js}

%\[\graph[xmin=-5, xmax=20, ymin=-3, ymax=4]{4arctan(x)/\pi}\]

%\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width = 4 in, height = 3 in, angle= -3]{graphical-limit05}
%\end{center}

\vspace{.25in}
Solution:  Since $x$ is approaching infinity, we look for a pattern on the right end of the graph.  
From the graph, we can see that the $y$-values are getting closer and closer to $2$ as the $x$ values 
increase without bound. We can conclude that 

\[
\lim_{x \to \infty}f(x) = 2,
\]

and we can describe the end behavior by saying that the line $y = 2$ is a \textbf{horizontal asymptote} for the graph of $f$.


\end{example}


\begin{problem}(problem 5)

  Use the graph of $y = f(x)$ given below to determine
  \[
  \lim_{x\to -\infty} f(x).
  \]
  
    \begin{hint}
      Look at the left end of the graph
    \end{hint}
    \begin{hint}
      The y-coordinates determine the limit
    \end{hint}
		\begin{hint}
		  Click on the graph and move the dot
		\end{hint}
		The value of the limit is
		 $\answer{0}$

\includeinteractive{glp05.js}
	
\end{problem}

Here is a problem that encompasses all of the ideas in this section.

\begin{problem}(problem 6)
  \includeinteractive{glproblem.js}
	\begin{leash}{220}
	Use the above graph of $y = f(x)$ to answer the following questions.\\
	
  
  What are the following function values (undefined is a possibility)?  
		 \[f(-4) = \answer{3}, \ f(-1) = \answer{-1} \]
		 \[f(0) = \answer{undefined}, \ f(1) = \answer{2} \]
	   \[f(4) = \answer{3}, \ f(6) = \answer{-3} \]
	Find the following one-sided limits. (You can click on the graph and drag a point along it.)
	\[\lim_{x\to -4^-} f(x) = \answer{3}, \ \lim_{x\to -4^+} f(x) = \answer{1}\]
	\[\lim_{x\to -1^-} f(x) = \answer{4}, \ \lim_{x\to -1^+} f(x) = \answer{-1}\]
	Type infinity for $\infty$ and -infinity for $-\infty$.
	\[\lim_{x\to 0^-} f(x) = \answer{-\infty}, \ \lim_{x\to 0^+} f(x) = \answer{\infty}\]
	\[\lim_{x\to 1^-} f(x) = \answer{1}, \ \lim_{x\to 1^+} f(x) = \answer{2}\]
	\[\lim_{x\to 4^-} f(x) = \answer{3}, \ \lim_{x\to 4^+} f(x) = \answer{2}\]
	\[\lim_{x\to 6^-} f(x) = \answer{0}, \ \lim_{x\to 6^+} f(x) = \answer{2}\]
	Find the following limits at infinity. (Click on the grid and drag it if necessary.  
	Press the home button on the right to reset the grid.)
	\[\lim_{x\to -\infty} f(x) = \answer{2}, \ \lim_{x\to \infty} f(x) = \answer{1}\]
	
	\end{leash}
\end{problem}



In the next few problems, we will reverse the situation.  Information about the limits and values of a function are given and you are asked to
construct the graph of the function.  Many answers are possible, but if your answer is correct, then your graph will have all of the properties listed.
