\section{Integration of Power Series}


Suppose that the power series 
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n
\]
converges for all $x$ in some open interval $I$. Then, on this interval, the power series has an anti-derivative which can be obtained by integrating term-by-term:


\[
\int \left( \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n \right) \, dx  = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  \int a_n x^n \, dx   
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty   \frac{a_n}{n+1} x^{n+1} + C.
\]
In other words, the indefinite integral of a power series is computed term by term, as we would anti-differentiate a polynomial.

\begin{example}[example 1]
The power series 
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n
\]
converges on the interval $(-1, 1)$.
On that interval, its anti-derivative is given by
\[
\int\left( \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n \right) \, dx= \sum_{n=0}^\infty  \big(\int x^n \, dx\big) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C.
\]
The interval of convergence of the anti-derivative is $[-1,1)$. In general, 
the anti-derivative might converge at an endpoint when the original series did not.
\end{example}



\begin{problem}(problem 1)
Find the anti-derivatives of the following power series. 
Also, compare the interval of convergence of the original series to its anti-derivative.
\[
a) \; \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n+1},\qquad b) \; \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{2^n},
\]
\[
c) \;  \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!},\qquad d) \; \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^{2n}
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{example}[example 2]
The power series expansion for the function $\frac{1}{1+x}$ is 
\[
\frac{1}{1+x} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n x^n, |x| < 1.
\]
Integrate the function and the series to obtain a power series representation for a logaritmic function.\\
First, note that
\[
\int \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln|1+x| + C.
\]
Integrating the power series:
\[
\int \left[\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n x^n \right] \, dx =  \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left[ \int(-1)^n x^n \, dx \right] = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  (-1)^n \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} +C.
\]
Equating these two antiderivatives, we have
\[
\ln|1+x| = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  (-1)^n \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} +C, \; -1 < x \leq 1,
\]
If we set $x = 0$, we can find $C$:
\[
\ln(1) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  (-1)^n \frac{0^{n+1}}{n+1} +C = 0 + C,
\]
so $C = \ln(1) = 0$. Hence,
\[
\ln|1+x| = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  (-1)^n \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}, \; -1 < x < 1,
\]
and we have a power series representiation for a logarithmic function.

\begin{remark}[Remark 1]
Note that the above series converges when $x = 1$ since it is the alternating harmonic series. Substituting $x = 1$ gives its sum:
\[
\ln(2) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  (-1)^n \frac{1^{n+1}}{n+1} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  (-1)^n \frac{1}{n+1} = 1 - \frac12 + \frac13 - \frac14 + \cdots
\]
Hence, the sum of the alternating harmonic series is $\ln(2) \approx 0.7$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Remark 2]
Since $-1 < x\leq 1$ we have $0 < 1+x \leq 2$. Thus, the absolute value bars in the logarithm can be removed to obtain:
\[
\ln(1+x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  (-1)^n \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}, \; -1 < x \leq 1.
\]
\end{remark}

\end{example}

\begin{example}[example 3]
The power series representation for the function $\frac{1}{1+x^2}$ is 
\[
\frac{1}{1+x^2} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n x^{2n}, \; |x| < 1.
\]
Integrate the function and the series to obtain a power series representation for an inverse trigonometric function.\\
We have
\[
\int \frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx = \tan^{-1}(x) + C,
\]
and integrating the power series gives:
\[
\int \left[\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n x^{2n} \right] \, dx =  \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left[ \int(-1)^n x^{2n} \, dx \right] = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} +C.
\]
Equating these two antiderivatives, we have
\[
\tan^{-1}(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} +C, \; |x| < 1
\]
If we set $x = 0$, we can find $C$:
\[
\tan^{-1}(0) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  (-1)^n \frac{0^{2n+1}}{2n+1} +C = 0 + C,
\]
so $C = \tan^{-1}(0) = 0$ and we have the following power series representation for the inverse tangent function:
\[
\tan^{-1}(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} +C, \; |x| < 1
\]
\begin{remark}[Remark]
If we substitute $x = 1$ into both sides of the power series representation, we obtain:
\[
\tan^{-1}(1) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  (-1)^n \frac{1^{2n+1}}{2n+1} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  (-1)^n \frac{1}{2n+1} 
\]
Since $\tan^{-1}(1) = \pi/4$, we can multiply by $4$ to obtain an infinite series whose sum is $\pi$:
\[
\pi = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  (-1)^n \frac{4}{2n+1} = 4 - \frac43 + \frac45 - \frac47 + \cdots
\]
