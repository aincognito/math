\section{Concavity}

In this section we will discuss the {\bf curvature} of the graph of a given function. 
There are two types of curvature: {\bf concave up} and {\bf concave down}.  
The main tool for discussing curvature is the second derivative, $f''(x)$.





\begin{definition}[Concavity]
Suppose $f(x)$ is differentiable on an open interval, $I$.
If $f'(x)$ is increasing on $I$, then $f(x)$ is \textbf{concave up} on $I$ and
if $f'(x)$ is decreasing on $I$, then $f(x)$ is \textbf{concave down} on $I$.
\end{definition}

%Graphically, the above definitions correspond to the following.  
%If $f(x)$ is concave up on $I$, then the graph of $y=f(x)$
%lies above its tangent lines, and if $f(x)$ is concave down on $I$, 
%then the graph lies below its tangent lines.

%The simplest examples to illustrate this are $f(x) = x^2$, which is concave up 
%everywhere and $f(x) = -x^2$
%which is concave down everywhere. 
%Make a rough sketch of each of these functions including a few tangent lines to see this.

The following theorem helps us to determine where a function is concave up and 
where it is concave down.\\

\begin{theorem}[Concavity]
If $f''(x) > 0$ on an interval $I$, then $f(x)$ is concave up on $I$ and
if $f''(x) < 0$ on an interval $I$, then $f(x)$ is concave down on $I$.
\end{theorem}



\begin{example}[example 1]
Find intervals where the function $f(x) = x^2$ is concave up or concave down.\\
The second derivative is given by
\[
f''(x) = 2
\]
Since $f''(x) > 0$ for all values of $x$, $f(x) = x^2$ is concave up on the 
interval $(-\infty, \infty)$. This is clear based on the graph of $y = x^2$ as well.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[example 2]
Find intervals where the function $f(x) = e^x$ is concave up or concave down.\\
The second derivative is given by
\[
f''(x) = e^x
\]
Since $f''(x) > 0$ for all values of $x$, $f(x) = e^x$ is concave up on the 
interval $(-\infty, \infty)$. This is clear based on the graph of $y = e^x$ as well.
\end{example}


\begin{example}[example 3]
Find intervals where the function $f(x) = x^3$ is concave up or concave down.\\
The second derivative is given by
\[
f''(x) = 6x
\]
Since $f''(x)$ has the same sign as $x$ itself, $f(x) = x^3$ is concave up on the 
interval $(0, \infty)$ and concave down on the interval $(-\infty, 0)$. 
This is clear based on the graph of $y = x^3$ as well.
\end{example}



The last example brings up a new concept.  The function $f(x) = x^3$ changes concavity at $x = 0$.  
We call this an {\bf inflection point} of the function.\\

\begin{definition}
If $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=a$ and $f(x)$ changes concavity at $x = a$, then
we say that $f(x)$ has an \textbf{inflection point} at $x = a$.
\end{definition} 

In the next two examples, we will discuss the curvature of the given functions and 
find their inflection points.

\begin{example}[example 4]
Determine where the cubic polynomial $f(x) = x^3 + 12x^2 - 7x + 10$ is concave up, 
concave down and find the inflection points.\\
The second derivative of $f(x)$ is 
$f''(x) = 6x + 24$.  To determine where $f''(x)$ is positive and where it is negative, 
we will first determine where it is zero. Hence, we will solve the equation
\[f''(x) = 0\]
for $x$.

We have $6x + 24 = 0$ so $x = -4$.
This value breaks the real number line into two intervals, $(-\infty, -4)$ and $(-4, \infty)$.
The second derivative maintains the same sign throughout each of these intervals.  
To determine whether it is positive or negative, we choose a test point in each interval.
For the interval, $(-\infty, -4)$, we choose $x = -5$.  
Plugging this into the second derivative, we get
$f''(-5) = 6(-5) + 24 = -6 < 0$. Next, we choose the test point 
$x = 0$ for the interval $(-4, \infty)$.  Plugging this into the second 
derivative gives $f''(0) = 6(0) + 24 = 24 > 0$.
We can use this information to create a sign chart for the second derivative, as shown below.

We can now use the concavity theorem to conclude that
the original function,
$f(x) = x^3 + 12x^2 - 7x +10$ is concave down on the interval $(-\infty, -4)$.
and concave up on the interval $(-4, \infty)$.
Finally, noting that the original polynomial is continuous everywhere and changes 
concavity at $x = -4$, we can say that
$f(x) = x^3 + 12x^2 - 7x +10$ has an inflection point at $x = -4$.

\end{problem}


\begin{example}[example 5]
Determine where the cubic polynomial $f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 36x + 2$ is concave up, 
concave down and find the inflection points.\\
The second derivative of $f(x)$ is
\[
f''(x) = 12x + 6
\]
To determine where $f''(x)$ is positive and where it is negative, 
we will first determine where it is zero. Hence, we will solve the equation
\[f''(x) = 0\]
for $x$.

We have $12x + 6 = 0$ so $x = -1/2$.
This value breaks the real number line into two intervals, $(-\infty, -1/2)$ and $(-1/2, \infty)$.
The second derivative maintains the same sign throughout each of these intervals.  
To determine whether it is positive or negative, we choose a test point in each interval.
For the interval, $(-\infty, -1/2)$, we choose $x = -1$.  
Plugging this into the second derivative, we get
$f''(-1) = 12(-1) + 6 = -6 < 0$.  

Next, for the interval $(-1/2, \infty)$, we choose the test point 
$x = 0$.  Plugging this into the second derivative gives $f''(0) = 12(0) + 6 = 6 > 0$.

We can now use the concavity theorem to conclude that

$f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 36x +2$ is concave down on the interval $(-\infty, -\frac12)$,
and concave up on the interval $(-\frac12, \infty)$.

\]
\end{problem}


\begin{example}[example 6]
Determine where the function $f(x) = x^2e^{3x}$ is concave up, concave down and find 
the inflection points.\\
To find $f''(x)$, 
we will need to use the product rule twice. First, 
\[f'(x) = x^2 \cdot 3e^{3x} + 2xe^{3x} = (3x^2 + 2x)e^{3x},\]
and second
\[f''(x) = (3x^2 + 2x)\cdot 3e^{3x} + (6x + 2)e^{3x} = (9x^2 + 12x + 2)e^{3x}.\]
Now that we have the second derivative, we set it equal to zero.  Solve
\[(9x^2 + 12x + 2)e^{3x}=0\]
for $x$.
Since the exponential $e^{3x}$ is never equal to zero, the only solutions come from 
setting the quadratic to zero:
\[9x^2 + 12x + 2=0.\]
This quadratic does not factor, so we need to use the quadratic formula.
The solutions are 
\[x = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{12^2 - 4(9)(2)}}{2(9)} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2}}{3}.\]
For simplicity, we will call these two roots $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
So 
\[\alpha = \frac{-2 - \sqrt{2}}{3} \approx -1.138\]
and
\[\beta = \frac{-2 + \sqrt{2}}{3} \approx -0.195\]

These two values break the real number line into three intervals: $(-\infty, \alpha), 
(\alpha, \beta)$ and $(\beta, \infty)$ with test points
$x = -2, x = -1$ and $x = 0$, respectively.
Plugging these into the second derivative gives
\[f''(-2) = (9(-2)^2 + 12(-2) + 2)e^{3(-2)} = 14e^{-6} > 0,\]
\[f''(-1) = (9(-1)^2 + 12(-1) + 2)e^{3(-1)} = -e^{-3} < 0,\]
and
\[f''(0) = (9(0)^2 + 12(0) + 2)e^{3(0)} = 2 > 0.\]

\begin{axis}[axis lines = center,  axis y line=none, xmin=-2.66, xmax = 1.33,

We can now use the concavity theorem to conclude that
the original function, $f(x) = x^2 e^{3x}$ is concave up on the intervals $(-\infty, \alpha)$ 
and $(\beta, \infty)$ and it is concave down on the interval 
$(\alpha, \beta)$.
Finally, we can infer from this that the continuous function $f(x) = x^2 e^{3x}$ has 
inflection points at 
\[
x = \alpha= \dfrac{-2 - \sqrt{2}}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \beta = \dfrac{-2 + \sqrt{2}}{3}.

\begin{example}[example 7]
Determine where the function $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$ is concave up, concave down and find the 
inflection points.\\
By the chain rule, its derivative is 
\[
f'(x) = -2xe^{-x^2}
\]
and by the product rule (and the chain rule again, as well), its second derivative is
\[
f''(x) = (-2x)(-2x)e^{-x^2} + (-2)e^{-x^2} = (4x^2 - 2)e^{-x^2}.
\]
Setting the second derivative equal to zero and noting that the exponential $e^{-x^2}$ is
always positive, we get
\[
4x^2 - 2 = 0.
\]
Solving for $x$ gives
\[
x^2 = \frac 12 \implies  x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx \pm 0.707
\]

These two values of $x$ break the real number line into three 
intervals: $(-\infty, -\tfrac{1}{\sqrt 2}),
(-\tfrac{1}{\sqrt 2}, \tfrac{1}{\sqrt 2})$ and $(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt 2}, \infty)$. 
The sign of $f''(x)$ will remain the same on each of these intervals. 
To determine the sign on each interval, we use the test points
$x = -1, x = 0$ and $x = 1$ respectively.
Plugging the test points into the second derivative gives
\[
f''(-1) = (4(-1)^2 - 2) e^{-(-1)^2} = 2e^{-1} > 0
\]
\[
f''(0) = (4(0)^2 - 2) e^{-(0)^2} = -2 < 0
\]
and
\[
f''(1) = (4(1)^2 - 2) e^{-(1)^2} = 2e^{-1} > 0.
\]

We can now use the concavity theorem to conclude that
the original function, $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$
is concave up on the intervals $(-\infty, -\frac{1}{\sqrt 2})$ and $(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}, \infty)$ and 
concave down on the interval $(-\frac{1}{\sqrt 2},\frac{1}{\sqrt 2})$. 
Finally, since the original function is continuous everywhere, we can
say that $x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}$ are inflection points for $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$.

\begin{example}[example 8]
Determine where the cubic polynomial $f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x}$ is concave up, concave down and 
find the inflection points.\\
From the power rule with $n = -1$, we have 
\[
f'(x) = -\frac{1}{x^2}
\]
and its second derivative is (power rule, $n = -2$)
\[
f''(x) = \frac{2}{x^3}.
\]
Now we make the observation that $x^3$ has the same sign as $x$ and so $f''(x)$ will have 
the same sign as $x$
in this example. Thus $f''(x) > 0$ on the interval $(0, \infty)$ and $f''(x) < 0$ on the 
interval $(-\infty,0).$
We conclude that $f(x)$ is concave up on $(0, \infty)$ and concave down on the 
interval $(-\infty, 0).$ 
Since $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ is \textbf{not} continuous at $x=0$ (it has an infinite 
discontinuity there), 
there is no inflection point there.

\section{Using the graph of the derivative}
In this section, we are given the graph of the derivative, $f'(x)$, and we are 
asked to make conclusions about the original function, $f(x)$.

\begin{example}[example 9]
Use the graph of $f'(x)$, shown below, to answer the following questions about the graph of $f(x)$.
Where is $f(x)$ increasing/decreasing and where are its local extremes?
Where is $f(x)$ concave up/down and where are its inflection points?

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.6]
\draw[<->, thick] (-4, 0)-- (4,0);
\draw[<->, thick] (0, -1.5)-- (0, 3.5);
\node at (0, 4.8) {The graph of the derivative, $y = f'(x)$};
\node at (4.3,0) {$x$};
\node at (0,3.8) {$y$};
\draw[blue, thick]   plot[smooth,domain=-4:4] (\x, {-1 + \x*\x/4});
\node at (-2.3,-0.65) {$-2$};
\node at (2.1,-0.65) {$2$};
\node at (4.9, 1.8) {$y = f'(x)$};
\draw[thin] (-2, -.3)--(-2,.3);

\draw[thin] (2, -0.3)--(2, 0.3);

%\draw[blue, fill] (1.57,2) circle [radius=0.07];

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

To answer the first question, recall that when $f'(x) > 0$, then $f(x)$ is increasing,
and when $f'(x) < 0$, then $f(x)$ is decreasing.  From the graph, we see that $f'(x)$ is 
positive on the intervals 
$(-\infty, -2)$ and $(2, \infty)$.  Hence, the graph of $f(x)$ is increasing on 
these intervals. We can also see that 
$f'(x)$ is negative on the interval $(-2, 2)$ and therefore $f(x)$ is decreasing on this interval.
We can now use the first derivative test to determine the nature of the local extremes. 
Since $f'(-2) = 0$ and $f'(x)$
changes sign from positive to negative at $x = -2$, the function, $f(x)$, has a 
local maximum at $x = -2$.
Similarly, Since $f'(2) = 0$ and $f'(x)$
changes sign from negative to positive at $x = 2$, the function, $f(x)$, has a 
local minimum at $x = 2$.\\
To determine the concavity of $f(x)$,recall that $f(x)$ is concave up when $f'(x)$ is 
increasing and $f(x)$
is concave down when $f'(x)$ is decreasing.  From the graph, we see that $f'(x)$ is 
increasing on the interval $(0, \infty)$,
and decreasing on the interval $(-\infty, 0)$. Hence, the graph of $f(x)$ is 
concave up on $(0, \infty)$
and concave down on $(-\infty, 0)$.  Finally, $f(x)$ has an inflection 
point at $x = 0$ due to the change in concavity there.

\end{image}

To answer the first question, recall that when $f'(x) > 0$, then $f(x)$ is increasing,
and when $f'(x) < 0$, then $f(x)$ is decreasing.  From the graph, we see 
that $f'(x)$ is positive on the intervals 
$(0, 2)$ and $(2, \infty)$.  Hence, the graph of $f(x)$ is increasing on 
these intervals. We can also see that 
$f'(x)$ is negative on the interval $(-\infty, 0)$ and therefore $f(x)$ is 
decreasing on this interval.
We can now use the first derivative test to determine the nature of the local extremes. 
Since $f'(0) = 0$ and $f'(x)$
changes sign from negative to positive at $x = 0$, the function, $f(x)$, has a 
local minimum at $x = 0$.
The situation at $x = 2$ is different. From the graph, we see that $f'(2) = 0$ 
but $f'(x)$ does not change sign at $x = 2$- 
it is positive on either side. Thus, $f(x)$ does not have a local extreme at the 
critical number, $x = 2$.\\
To determine the concavity of $f(x)$,recall that $f(x)$ is concave up when $f'(x)$ is 
increasing and $f(x)$
is concave down when $f'(x)$ is decreasing.  From the graph, we see that $f'(x)$ is 
increasing on the intervals $(-\infty, .7)$
and $(2, \infty)$ and decreasing on the interval $(0.7, 2)$. Hence, the 
graph of $f(x)$ is concave up on $(-\infty, .7)$ and $(2, \infty)$
and concave down on $(.7, 2)$.  Finally, $f(x)$ has an inflection 
points at $x = .7$ and $x = 2$ due to the changes in concavity at these points.

We next explore a special relationship between concavity and local extremes.

\begin{theorem}[Second Derivative Test]
Suppose $f'(a) = 0$.
If $f''(a) < 0$, then $f(x)$ has a local maximum at $x = a$, and
if $f''(a) > 0$, then $f(x)$ has a local minimum at $x = a$
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}[example 11]
Use the Second Derivative Test to find the local extremes of 
\[
f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 - 36x +2.
\]
The critical numbers of $f(x)$ are $x = -2$ and $x = 3$ (verify).
Next, $f''(x) = 12x - 6$ (verify).
Plugging the critical numbers into the second derivative gives,
\[f''(-2) = -30 < 0 \; \text{and} \; f''(3) = 30 >0.\]
By the Second Derivative Test, $f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 -36x +2$ has a local 
maximum at $x = -2$ and a local minimum at $x =3$.

\begin{problem}(problem 11)

$f(x)$ has a local maximum at $x = \answer{2}$ and a local minimum at $x = \answer{4}.$
