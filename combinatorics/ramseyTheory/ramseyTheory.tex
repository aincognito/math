\section{Ramsey Theory}

In this section we consider graph colorings. That is, each edge in a graph will be assigned a particular color.
The graph below is a $K_3$ colored with red and blue edges. The vertices represent people and the color represents whether
they know each other (red) or not (blue).

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[fill] (0,0) circle (1pt) node[left]{A};
\draw[fill] (2,0) circle (1pt) node[right]{B};
\draw[fill] (1,1) circle (1pt)node[above]{C};
\draw[red] (0,0) -- (2,0);
\draw[blue] (0,0) -- (1,1);
\draw[blue] (2,0) -- (1,1);
\node at (1,-0.5) {A and B know each other,};
\node at (1, -1){B and C do not};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

The Pigeon Hole Principle suggests that in a $K_3$ with two colors, there must be two of the same color.
Hence, in a group of three people, there are at least 2 pairs of people that know each other or 
two pairs of people that do not.

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[fill] (0,0) circle (1pt) node[left]{A};
\draw[fill] (2,0) circle (1pt) node[right]{B};
\draw[fill] (1,1) circle (1pt)node[above]{C};
\draw[red] (0,0) -- (2,0);
\draw[red] (0,0) -- (1,1);
\draw[red] (2,0) -- (1,1) ;
\node at (1,-0.5){Three people, each of whom knows the others};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[fill] (0,0) circle (1pt) node[left]{A};
\draw[fill] (2,0) circle (1pt) node[right]{B};
\draw[fill] (1,1) circle (1pt)node[above]{C};
\draw[blue] (0,0) -- (2,0)node[midway,below = 6pt, black]{Three people, none of whom knows another};
\draw[blue] (0,0) -- (1,1);
\draw[blue] (2,0) -- (1,1) ;
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

A fundamental question in Ramsey Theory is: how many people are needed in order to ensure that 
there is a subgroup of 3 people that are either mutually acquainted or mutually unacquainted?
In terms of graphs with edge colorings, what is the smallest value of $n$ such that $K_n$ with 2 colors 
must contain a monochromatic $K_3$? This value of $n$ is known as a Ramsey Number and denoted $R(3,3)$

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[fill] (0,0) circle (1pt)node[ left]{A} ;
\draw[fill] (2,0) circle (1pt)node[right]{D} ;
\draw[fill] (0,2) circle (1pt)node[left]{B};
\draw[fill] (2,2) circle (1pt)node[right]{C};
\draw[blue] (0,0) -- (2,0)node[midway,below = 6pt, black]{$K_4$ with no monochromatic $K_3$};
\draw[red] (0,0) -- (2,2);
\draw[red] (0,0) -- (0,2) ;
\draw[blue] (2,0) -- (0,2) ;
\draw[red] (2,0) -- (2,2) ;
\draw[blue] (2,2) -- (0,2) ;
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

The figure above shows that $R(3,3) > 4$. 

\begin{problem}(problem 1) 
Show that $R(3,3) > 5$ by exhibiting an edge coloring on $K_5$ that does not contain a monochromatic $K_3$
\end{problem}

We now prove that $R(3,3) = 6$. 

\begin{theorem}[$R(3,3) = 6$]
The smallest number of vertices $n$ for which a $K_n$ with edges colored red and blue must contain a 
monochromatic $K_3$ is 6, i.e., $R(3,3) = 6$.
% $K_6$ with blue and red edge colorings must contain a monochromatic $K_3$
%and $6$ is the smallest number of vertices for which this is true.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Consider a $K_6$ with edges colored red and blue. 
We must show that it contains a monochromatic $K_3$. Let $V$ be any vertex in the $K_6$. 
V has 5 edges emanating from it.  By the Pigeon Hole Principle, there must be at least 3 of the same color.

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[fill] (0,0) circle (1pt)node[ left]{V} ;
\draw[fill] (2,2) circle (1pt)node[right]{A} ;
\draw[fill] (2,1) circle (1pt)node[right]{B};
\draw[fill] (2,0) circle (1pt)node[right]{C};
\draw[fill] (2,-1) circle (1pt)node[right]{D};
\draw[fill] (2,-2) circle (1pt)node[right]{E};
\draw[red] (0,0) -- (2,2);
\draw[red] (0,0) -- (2,1);
\draw[red] (0,0) -- (2,0) ;
\draw[blue] (0,0) -- (2,-1) ;
\draw[blue] (0,0) -- (2,-2) ;
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

Without loss of generality, assume $V$ is connected to vertices $A, B$ and $C$ with red edges, as pictured above. 
Then consider the $K_3$ embedded in the $K_6$ consisting of vertices $A, B$ and $C$.
If this $K_3$ contains a red edge, say from $A$ to $B$, then the $K_3$ formed by $V, A$ and $B$ is monochromatic (red).
If the $K_3, (A, B, C)$ does not contain a red edge, then IT is a monochromatic $K_3$ (blue).
Either way, the $K_6$ must contain a monochromatic $K_3$. Finally, since $R(3,3) > 5$ we can conclude that $R(3,3) = 6$.

\end{proof}


We can use more than two colors. Suppose we use green, red and blue to color the edges of $K_n$. 
What is the minimum value of $n$ that guarantees a monochromatic $K_3$? This Ramsey Number is denoted $R(3,3,3)$.

\begin{theorem}[$R(3,3,3) = 17$]
Let $V$ be a vertex of $K_{17}$ with edges colored green, red and blue. There are 16 edges emanating from $V$.
By the Pigeon Hole Principle, there must be at least 6 of one color (otherwise, we would have at most 5 of each color
and 5+5+5 = 15 <16).  Which color this is is unimportant, so let's say it is green. Thus we can say that the vertex $V$ is 
joined to the vertices $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6$ by green edges. Now, if any of the edges connecting an $A_i$
with an $A_j$ are green, then $V, A_i, A_j$ would be a green $K_3$ and hence the $K_{17}$ would have a monochromatic 
$K_3$ as claimed. So now we must consider the possibility that none of the edges connecting and $A_i$ to any other $A_j$
is colored green.  In this case, all of the edges among the 6 vertices $A_1, A_2, ..., A_6$ would be 
colored either red or blue.  Thus we would have a $K_6$ colored with two colors embedded in our $K_{17}$.  
By the previous theorem, $R(3,3) = 6$, so we are guaranteed that this embedded $K_6$ contains a monochromatic $K_3$.
We can now conclude that $R(3,3,3) \leq 17$. To see that it is actually 17, we must exhibit a coloring of $K_{16}$ with three 
colors that does not contain  a monochromatic $K_3$.  
The standard example is pictured below. The three identical monochromatic subgraphs are know as the Clebsch graph.

\end{theorem}

\begin{problem}
Suppose $K_n$ is colored using 4 colors: yellow, green, red and blue. The smallest value of $n$ that guarantees
a monochromatic $K_3$ is denoted $R(3,3,3,3)$. Show that $R(3,3,3,3) \leq 66$\\

\begin{hint}
Use the fact that $R(3,3,3) = 17$
\end{hint}
How many edges must emanate from a vertex $V$ in $K_n$ to ensure that there are at least 17 of one color? $\answer{65}$\\
How many vertices must a graph have to be sure that this many edges emanate from each vertex? $\answer{66}$
