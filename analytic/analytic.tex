\title{3.4 Analytic Functions}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
We determine if a function is analytic using the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
\end{abstract}

\maketitle

\begin{definition}
We say that $f(z)$ is analytic at $z_0$ if $f$ is differentiable on $D(z_0, r)$ for some $r>0$.
Furthermore, $f(z)$ is called analytic on a region $R$ if it is analytic at each point in $R$.
\end{definition}


\begin{example}[example 1]
Recall from section 3.2 that the function $f(z) = \overline{z}^2$ is differentiable 
at $z=0$ and nowhere else. Thus,
$f(z) = \overline{z}^2$ is not differentiable on any disk of positive radius. 
Hence, $f(z) = \overline{z}^2$ is nowhere analytic.
\end{example}

\begin{problem}(problem 1)
Where is the function $f(z) = (x^3 + 3xy^2) +i(3x^2y+y^3)$ analytic?\\
$u_x = \answer{3x^2+3y^2} \quad \text{and} \quad u_y = \answer{6xy}$\\
$v_x = \answer{6xy} \quad \text{and} \quad v_y = \answer{3x^2 + 3y^2}$\\

\begin{example}[example 2]
The function $f(z) = e^z$ is differentiable at every point in $\C$ and hence 
it is analytic everywhere in $\C$.

Like the real variable case, an analytic function whose derivative is zero is a constant.

\begin{theorem}
Suppose $f(z)$ is analytic in a disk, $D$. If $f'(z) =0$ on $D$.
then $f(z) =c$ on $D$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
First note that since $f'=0$ on $D$, the partial derivatives $u_x, u_y, v_x$ and $v_y$ 
are all zero on the disk.
Suppose $z_1, z_2 \in D$ with $\Imp z_1 = \Imp z_2$. Then on the horizontal segment 
between $z_1$ and $z_2$, $u_x = 0$ implies that $u$ is constant 
on the segment and $v_x =0$ on the segment implies that $v$ is constant on the segment as well.
Now suppose $z_1, z_2 \in D$ with $\Rep z_1 = \Rep z_2$. Then on the vertical segment 
between $z_1$ and $z_2$, $u_y = 0$ implies that $u$ is constant 
on the segment and $v_y =0$ on the segment implies that $v$ is constant on the segment as well.
Finally, any two points $z_1, z_2 \in D$ can be connected by a horizontal and a 
vertical segment and $f$ is constant on these segments, so $f(z_1) = f(z_2)$.
Since $z_1$ and $z_2$ were arbitrary, $f(z) =c$ on $D$. 
\end{proof}

In a vane similar to the previous theorem, if the modulus of an analytic function is constant, 
then the function itself is constant.

\begin{theorem}
Suppose $f(z)$ is analytic in a disk $D$. If $|f(z)| = m$ on  $D$, then $f(z) =c$ on $D$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If $m =0$, the $f$ is identically zero, so suppose $m>0$. The definition of modulus gives
\[
u^2(x,y) + v^2(x,y) = m^2
\]
Taking the partial derivative of both sides with respect to $x$ and with respect to $y$ gives the system
\[
2uu_x +2vv_x = 0
\]
\[
2uu_y + 2vv_y = 0
\]
Dividing by $2$ and using the Cauchy-Riemann equations selectively gives
\[
uu_x -vu_y = 0
\]
\[
uu_y + vu_x = 0
\]
Multiplying the first equation by $u$ and the second equation by $v$ gives
\[
u^2u^x - uvu_y=0
\]
\[
uvu_y + v^2u_x = 0
\]
adding these equations together gives
\[
\left(u^2 +v^2\right)u_x = m^2u_x = 0
\]
which gives $u_x = 0$ on $D$. We could have eliminated $u_x$ instead of $u_y$ which would 
have led to $u_y =0$ on $D$.
Hence $u$ is constant on $D$. Moreover, by the Cauchy-Riemann equations $v_x=0$ and $v_y=0$ on $D$ and 
so $v$ is constant on $D$ as well.
Thus $f = u+iv$ is constant on $D$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}(linear system)
Solve the system for $u_y$:
\[
uu_x -vu_y = 0
\]
\[
uu_y + vu_x = 0
\]
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{$u_y= 0$}
\choice{$u_y = -u_x$}
\choice{$u_y = m^2$}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}


\begin{definition}
A function that is analytic at every point in $\C$ is called {\bf entire}.
